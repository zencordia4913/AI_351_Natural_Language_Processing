\"abstract abstract-in this paper we propose a general framework for performance improvement of the current state-of-the-art registration algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computation time. the key concept involves rapid prediction of a deformation field for registration initialization which is achieved by a statistical correlation model learned between image appearances and deformation fields. this allows us to immediately bring a template image as close as possible to a subject image that we need to register. the task of the registration algorithm is hence reduced to estimating small deformation between the subject image and the initially warped template image i.e. the intermediate template it. specifically to obtain a good subject-specific initial deformation support vector regression is utilized to determine the correlation between image appearances and their respective deformation fields. when registering a new subject onto the template an initial deformation field is first predicted based on the subject's image appearance for generating an it. with the it only the residual deformation needs to be estimated presenting much less challenge to the existing registration algorithms. our learning-based framework affords two important advantages: 1 by requiring only the estimation of the residual deformation between the it and the subject image the computation time can be greatly reduced 2 by leveraging good deformation initialization local minima giving suboptimal solution could be avoided. our framework has been extensively evaluated using medical images from different sources and the results indicate that on top of accuracy improvement significant registration speedup can be achieved as compared with the case where no prediction of initial deformation is performed.\\nindex terms-deformation prediction fast image registration principal component analysis pca support vector regression svr.\",

interactions partly shape student performance. however there is little work on discrimination within the classroom. do teachers give better grades to children of their own race ethnicity or gender? a u.s. nationally representative longitudinal data set that includes both test scores and teacher assessments offers a unique opportunity to answer this question. i look at the effect of being assessed by a same-race or same-gender teacher conditional on test scores child effects and teacher effects. this strategy controls for three confounding effects: i children of different races and genders may react differently in the classroom and during examinations ii teachers may capture skills that are not captured by test scores and iii tough teachers may be matched with specific races or genders. results indicate that teachers give higher assessments to children of their own race but not significantly higher assessments to children of their own gender. this effect seems to be driven largely by the differential assessments given to non-hispanic black and hispanic children: white teachers give significantly lower assessments to non-hispanic black children and to hispanic children. results are robust to various checks on endogenous mobility measurement error and reverse causality. moreover children's behavior is not a significant determinant of same-race or same-gender matching. finally

carried out. the work presented in this paper is motivated by the need for an automated cortical surface normalization technique that will automatically identify homologous cortical landmarks and map them to the same coordinates on a standard manifold. the geometry of a cortical surface is analyzed using two shape measures that distinguish the sulcal and gyral regions in a multiscale framework. a multichannel optical flow warping procedure aligns these shape measures between a reference brain and a subject brain creating the desired normalization. the partial differential equation that carries out the warping is implemented in a euclidean framework in order to facilitate a multiresolution strategy thereby permitting large deformations between the two surfaces. the technique is demonstrated by aligning 33 normal cortical surfaces and showing both improved structural alignment in manually labeled sulci and improved functional alignment in positron emission tomography data mapped to the surfaces. a quantitative comparison between our proposed surface-based spatial normalization method and a leading volumetric spatial normalization method is included to show that the surface-based

mortality presumably due to low muscle mass. notably muscle power declines more rapidly than muscle strength with increasing age which may be related to more complex central nervous system movement control. we examined arm-cranking power against four workloads and isometric strength measured in the upper extremities of 993 men longitudinally tested over a 25-yr period. muscle mass was estimated by using 24-h creatinine excretion physical activity was assessed by self-reported questionnaire. muscle power and strength were modeled by time by using mixed-effects models which developed regression equations for each individual. the first derivative of these equations estimated rate of change in strength or power at each evaluation. survival analyses using the counting method examined the impact of strength power and their rates of change on all-cause mortality while adjusting for age. armcranking power [relative risk rr ϭ 0.984 per 100 kg⅐m⅐min ϫ1  p ͻ 0.001] was a stronger predictor of mortality than was arm strength rr ϭ 0.986 per 10 kg p ϭ not significant whereas rate of power change rr ϭ 0.989 per 100 kg⅐min ϫ1 ⅐yr ϫ1  and rate of arm strength change rr ϭ 0.888 per 10 kg/yr were risks independent of the power or strength levels. the impacts of power and strength were partially independent of muscle mass and physical activity. the risk of mortality was similar across the four power workloads rr ϭ 0.93-0.96 per 100 kg⅐m⅐min ϫ1  whereas the lowest load generated less than one-half the power as the higher loads. arm-cranking power is a risk factor for mortality independent of muscle strength physical activity and muscle mass. the impact is found with loads that do not generate maximal power suggesting an important role for motor coordination and speed of movement. muscle mass aging physical activity aging is associated with declines in muscle strength [whether measured isometrically or isokinetically 2 8 12 22 27 32 ] and muscle mass 12 26 27

assessed by handgrip knee extension or using sit-ups 12 25 34 41 . mortality was more closely related to strength levels than to body mass 41 and at least in part was independent of muscle mass 34. although strength can be measured using different testing paradigms and in different upper or lower extremity muscle groups strong relationships are observed among various strength measurements 33. such relationships suggest that any strength measurement may reflect the pattern of strength within an individual. thus the relationship of muscle strength to mortality may lay in the higher

greater extent than muscle strength 3 4 6 28 29 31 32 46 . the observation is consistent across various power testing methodologies that include instantaneous knee extension power 3 4 jumping power 7 stair-climbing power 28 and cranking cycling power 28 32 46 . whereas strength is the force generated by a muscle power is the work force ϫ distance performed per unit of time or force times velocity of movement caused by the muscle.\\nmuscle strength is dependent on the length-tension relationship that specifies that there is an optimal muscle length for maximal force generation. for isometric contractions maximal strength is specific for the muscle or muscle group only at the tested joint angle. for isokinetic contractions the peak force will be angle dependent and specific to the velocity of movement. note that power can be calculated for the isokinetic contraction 47 but because velocity is controlled it does not represent maximal power capability. however peak torque at high velocity is highly correlated with power 23 43.\\nmaximal power emphasizes the force-velocity relationship which states that there exists a contraction velocity that maximizes power generation. to attain maximal power optimal force and velocity levels need to be achieved and these are measurement specific. the optimal force level to achieve maximal power may not represent maximal strength. similarly the optimal velocity may not represent the maximal velocity that can be attained. for example optimal cycling performance on a wingate test occurs in a fixed range of revolutions per minute not necessarily at the maximal revolutions per minute.\\nmuscle power is measured in several different ways that reflect different contributions of metabolic and neural control of muscle activity.

from hurricanes to the natural and human-modified landscape is critical for disaster management and for assessment of ecological and economic impacts. geospatial technologies including remote sensing rs geographic information systems/science gis and global positioning systems gps provide new tools for delineating damage potential and for assessing destruction after natural disasters. historically airborne and space rs missions have been used for post-hurricane impact assessment but these data are limited in a variety of ways. space-based rs data have limitations including differing specifications for spatial spectral and temporal resolution. as an example predicting damage or assessing damage from land-falling hurricanes via satellite data is often hampered by temporal resolution re-visit frequency that can result in unavailability of cloudfree images over impacted areas. airborne rs data are not temporally limited to a specific window of ground coverage and can even acquire data during cloudy conditions. airborne rs instruments may provide data of higher spectral and spatial resolution than space-borne instruments however complete 'wall-to-wall' coverage of landscapes impacted by tropical systems as large as hurricane katrina can be impractical and prohibitively expensive. consequently many geospatial analysts first use space-borne data and geospatial modeling at a relatively coarse-resolution to provide an overview of hurricane impacted areas and then they use this information to pinpoint locations where they need to acquire airborne rs data for higher-resolution subsets of damaged areas. therefore there is a need to develop more accurate geospatial models that incorporate readily available data at a regional scale to assist emergency and disaster management agencies with their decision-support. according to hodgson et al. 2010  agencies with first responder responsibilities have expressed the critical need for image acquisitions over disaster impacted areas within 24 hours or within three days of the event at a minimum. given the limitations for rapid acquisition of rs imagery over hurricane-impacted areas researchers at mississippi state university in coordination with mississippi emergency management agency mema advisors have developed a geospatial modeling-based tool that enables rapid depiction within 24 -48 hours

overlain on a variety of image and gis base layers to help plan for evacuation procedures prior to landfall and to help orient and manage the effective allocation of resources to impacted areas.\",

college if community colleges-or similar institutions-were not available alfonso 2004 rouse 1995 . the community college access mission is built on low tuition convenient location flexible scheduling an open-door admissions policy and programs and services designed to support at-risk students with a variety of social and academic barriers to postsecondary success cohen & brawer 1996 .\\nwhile community colleges have played a crucial role in opening access to higher education to a wide variety of students access alone is not sufficient. in recent years policy makers educators accreditors and scholars have increasingly turned their attention to student persistence and completion but most of the research and attention has focused on the educational outcomes of baccalaureate students and not those who begin at a community college.\\nmany community college students never finish a degree. indeed for students who enrolled in a community college as their first postsecondary enrollment in the 1995-96 academic year only 36 percent had completed either a certificate associate or bachelor's degree within six years. another 22 percent were still enrolled in college about three-fifths of those were enrolled in a four-year institution. therefore 42 percent of students who started college in a two-year public institution left college within six years after initial enrollment without a degree or certificate. low-income minority and first-generation college students all have even lower six-year completion rates. and those who do complete among these populations tend to earn lower-level credentials-for example a certificate rather than an associate or bachelor's degree. 1 how can community colleges improve their graduation rates? certainly one strategy would be to be more selective. extensive research has shown that students who have stronger high school records who come from higher income families whose parents also went to college who do not delay college entry after high school who attend full time and who do not interrupt their college studies are more likely to graduate adelman 1999 bailey alfonso scott & leinbach. in press cabrera burkum & la nasa in press . but such a strategy would defeat the purpose of the open-door community college institution. community colleges are committed to providing a place in higher education for all students who meet minimum criteria. in many states students can attend community college even if they do not have a high school diploma or equivalent and in many colleges a majority of students after being assessed are determined not to be prepared for college level coursework. the question facing community colleges then is not how to attract better students although surely many would like to do that but rather how to do a better job with the types of students they already have. indeed there is some evidence that colleges differ in their effectiveness in helping students to graduate since community college graduation rates vary significantly even after controlling for characteristics of the student body bailey calcagno jenkins leinbach & kienzl in press .\\nthe goal of the study presented here is to identify institutional characteristics that affect the success of community college students. in this article we examine several characteristics that are under the control of either the colleges or state policy makers. they include the size of the college tuition levels the use of part-time faculty overall expenditures per student the distribution of those expenditures among possible functions such as instruction administration and student services the extent to which the college focuses on certificates as opposed to associate degrees and the level of financial aid.\\nwhile there is extensive research on the determinants of educational outcomes for k-12 education hanushek 1986 and a growing literature on this topic for baccalaureate institutions few researchers have attempted to address the issue for community colleges. in this study we measure the probability that a student will have a successful educational outcome controlling for both their individual characteristics and the characteristics of the institutions that they attend. our sample is drawn from the national education longitudinal study of 1988 nels:88 which also provides our detailed individual level characteristics. our institutional variables are drawn from the integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds.\\nthe structure of this article is as follows. section 2 reviews the existing

the past few decades. opportunities for women and minorities have expanded and beliefs in equality for all have become more common e.g. koenig eagly mitchell & ristikari 2011 thornton & youngdemarco

marriage u.s. bureau of the census 2011.\\nhow have recent generations been shaped by these trends? at base generational differences are cultural differences: as cultures change their youngest members are socialized with new and different values. children growing up in the 1950s were exposed to a fundamentally different culture than children growing up in the 1990s for example. thus birth cohorts-commonly referred to as generations-are shaped by the larger sociocultural environment of different time periods e.g. gentile campbell & twenge 2012 stewart & healy 1989 twenge 2006  just as residents of different cultures are shaped by regional variations in culture e.g. markus & kitayama 1991 .\\nmany previous studies have examined generational differences in personality traits and positive self-views e.g. andré et al. 2010 gentile twenge & campbell 2010 stewart & bernhardt 2010 twenge campbell & gentile 2011 . fewer studies however have examined generational trends in values life goals and young people\\'s relationships to their communities. for example have young people\\'s life goals changed to become more or less community focused? how concerned are they for others? how much do they wish to be involved in collective or civic action? these questions about community feeling are important as they address crucial elements of social capital and group relations e.g. putnam 2000 . as the epigraph quotes illustrate there is a great deal of interest in-and disagreement about-whether or not today\\'s young people are higher or lower in community feeling. community feeling is also a key element of what kasser and colleagues e.g. grouzet et al. 2005 kasser & ryan 1993  1996 label intrinsic values those important to inherent psychological needs that contribute to actualization and growth such as selfacceptance affiliation and community. these are on the opposite end of the same dimension as extrinsic values those contingent on external feedback such as money fame and image. the current study seeks to expand the literature on generational differences by assessing changes in community feeling and the contrasting extrinsic values.\\nthe literature on generational differences is limited in other ways as well. most analyses have gathered data from other studies using cross-temporal meta-analysis instead of analyzing responses from large national surveys e.g. konrath o\\'brien & hsing 2011 malahy rubinlicht & kaiser 2009 twenge & foster 2010 . cross-temporal meta-analysis has the benefit of examining changes in well-established psychological measures but lacks the stratified nationally representative sampling of large national surveys. however these national surveys have limitations of their own. for example the meaning of some items in large national surveys is unclear. although most items are straightforward or behavioral-for example civic orientation items about political participation or concern for others items about community service or charity donations-others especially those asking about life goals are more ambiguous. for example when a respondent agrees that being a \"community leader\" is an important life goal does that reflect the value of community an intrinsic value or of wanting to be a leader an extrinsic value? several observers e.g. greenberg & weber 2008 pryor hurtado saenz santos & korn 2007 have assumed it reflects community feeling but this has never been confirmed by validating this item-or any other from these surveys-against psychometrically valid measures such as the aspirations index the most established measure of life goals grouzet et al. 2005 .\\nin the present study we attempt to address these issues by a examining changes in community feeling across as many survey items as possible in b two very large national databases and c validating relevant items against existing measures particularly those measuring community feeling and the larger dimension of intrinsic-extrinsic

we enhance the typical model of college matching by considering the social setting and high school feeder patterns of state universities. we find that racial and ethnic gaps in application rates particularly for hispanic students are not explained by differential levels of college readiness high school quality or information regarding college admission processes. when applying to college minorities are influenced by more than just matching their academic ability to the institution and prefer institutions with a large proportion of same-race students and campuses where same-race

only 62 percent of black and 60 percent of hispanic high school graduates enrolled in college the fall semester after high school graduation compared with 71 percent of white graduates nces 2016. a key goal of education policy is to help remediate this inequity by providing equal opportunity and access to all students. however to develop better policy one needs to understand the underlying causes of these disparities. there are many possible explanations including lack of information and different preferences. selective admissions processes can limit college access among minorities if high school quality and high school outcomes are unequally distributed by race and ethnicity. even before a student can enter an admissions process she must apply-a process that may be particularly daunting for a potential first-generation college student. although there are a few studies that investigate the admissions and enrollment process for minority students most begin with a sample of students who express college interest by taking a college entrance exam sat or act. in this study we first investigate racial and ethnic differences in the initial step in college enrollment-the application decision-using two full cohorts of recent texas high school graduates. because there is a common college application in texas see www.applytexas.org hereafter referred to as applytexas we are able to observe whether each student applied to each of the thirty-seven four-year public postsecondary institutions in the state. importantly because we observe the population of students and not just those students who applied or took the sat or act exam we can learn more broadly about differences in college application behavior. we do so in order to assess the differential roles of student demographics high school quality and student preparedness in the college application decision. importantly we also allow for effects of race to differ based on student and high school characteristics.\\nonce we have done this we then examine the decision of where to apply conditional on applying. when deciding to apply to a college students can incorporate a number of different elements including their level of preparedness which could be a function of their high school quality and their performance in high school family characteristics and financial factors as well as the probability of acceptance. we focus on understanding the importance of student-campus fit by estimating the influence of academic match campus demographics and high school feeder patterns on behavior

can be caused by a primary testicular pathology primary hypogonadism otherwise known as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism resulting from malfunction at the level of the testes due to a genetic cause injury inflammation or infection boxes 12. conversely hypothalamic and/or pituitary failures lead to secondary hypogonadism also called central hypogonadism or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism which is most often caused by genetic defects neoplasm or infiltrative disorders boxes 12 .\\nsigns and symptoms of hypogonadism depend on the age of onset the severity of androgen deficiency and the underlying cause of androgen deficiency 3 . in healthy childhood testosterone is low and spermatozoa are not produced thus decreased sertoli cell function as reflected by low inhibin b and amh is the cardinal sign of hypogonadism before puberty. conditions impairing the hpg axis that occur during paediatric or pubertal life may result in delayed puberty defined as the lack of sexual maturation by an age at which 95-98% of the children have initiated sexual maturation 5 6 . in adulthood this can manifest as testosterone deficiency which is a clinical syndrome resulting from reduced testicular

hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis during paediatric or pubertal life may result in delayed puberty. late-onset hypogonadism is a clinical condition in the ageing male combining low concentrations of circulating testosterone and specific symptoms associated with impaired hormone production. testosterone therapy for congenital forms of hypogonadism must be lifelong whereas testosterone treatment of late-onset hypogonadism remains a matter of debate because of unclear indications for replacement uncertain efficacy and potential risks. this primer focuses on a reappraisal of the physiological role of testosterone with emphasis on the critical interpretation of the hypogonadal conditions throughout the lifespan of the male individual with the exception of hypogonadal states resulting from

that his previous work showed that \"psychologically meaningful and useful subscores can be obtained from conventional achievement tests\" baker herman & linn 1995 p. 133 . he went on to point out that these subscores represented important ability distinctions and showed different patterns of relationships with demographic \"affective\" emotional \"conative\" volitional  and instructional-experience characteristics of students. he concluded that \"a new multidimensional approach to achievement test validation should include affective and conative as well as cognitive reference constructs\" italics ours p. 134.\\nsnow see baker et al. 1995 left hints of what he meant by \"a new multidimensional approach\" when he wrote \"the primary objective of this study is to determine if knowledge and ability distinctions previously found important in high school math and science achievement tests occur also in other multiple-choice and constructed response assessments. . . . a second objective is to examine the cognitive and affective correlates of these distinctions. and a third objective is to examine alternative assessment designs that would sharpen and elaborate such knowledge and ability distinctions in such fields as math science and historygeography\" p. 133.\\nwe as snow\\'s students and colleagues have attempted to piece together his thinking about multidimensional validity and herein report our progress on a research program that addresses cognitive and motivational processes in high school science learning and achievement. to be sure if dick had been able to see this project through to this point it might well have turned out differently. nevertheless we attempted to be true to his ideas and relied heavily on the theoretical foundation of his work his conception of aptitude snow 1989 snow  1992 .\\nsnow called for broadening the concept of aptitude to recognize the complex and dynamic nature of person-situation interactions and to include motivational affective and conative processes in explaining individual differences in learning and achievement. previous results using a mixed methodology of large-scale statistical analyses and small-scale interview studies demonstrated the usefulness of a multidimensional representation of high school science achievement. we identified three distinct constructs underlying students\\' performance on a standardized test and sought validation evidence for the distinctions between \"basic knowledge and reasoning\" \"quantitative science\" and \"spatial-mechanical ability\" see . different patterns of relationships of these dimensions with student background variables instructional approaches and practices and out-of-school activities provided the groundwork for understanding the essential characteristics of each dimension. we found for example that gender differences in science achievement could be attributed to the spatial-mechanical dimension and not to aspects of quantitative reasoning or basic knowledge and facts.\\niv our studies reported in the set of six cse technical reports nos. 569-574 * extend the groundwork laid down in snow\\'s past research by introducing an extensive battery of motivational constructs and by using additional assessment formats. this research seeks to enhance our understanding of the cognitive and motivational aspects of student performance on different test formats: multiplechoice constructed response and performance assessments. the first report provides a framework for viewing multidimensional validity one that incorporates cognitive ability fluid quantitative verbal and visualization motivational and achievement constructs. in it we also describe the study design instrumentation and data collection procedures. as dick wished to extend his research on large-scale achievement tests beyond the national education longitudinal study of 1988 nels:88 we created a combined multiple-choice and constructed response science achievement test to measure basic knowledge and reasoning quantitative reasoning and spatial-mechanical ability from questions found in nels:88 the national assessment of educational progress naep and the third international mathematics and science study timss. we also explored what science performance assessments laboratory investigations added to this achievement mix. and we drew motivational items from instruments measuring competence beliefs task values and behavioral engagement in the science classroom. the second report in the set  focuses on cognitive and motivational aptitudes as predictors of science achievement. we ask whether once students\\' demographic characteristics and cognitive ability are taken into consideration motivational variables are implicated in science achievement. in the third report  we explore in some detail the ways in which students who vary in motivational patterns perform on basic knowledge and reasoning quantitative reasoning and spatial-mechanical reasoning subscales. it just might be as snow posited that such patterns interact with reasoning demands of the achievement test and thereby produce different patterns of performance and possibly different interpretations of achievement. the fourth report ayala yin schultz & shavelson 2002 then explores the link between large-scale achievement measures and measures of students\\' performance in laboratory investigations \"performance assessments\". the fifth report in the set explores in some detail the relation between varying motivational patterns and performance on different measurement methods. again following snow\\'s notion of a transaction between motivational aptitude and situations created by different test formats different patterns of performance might be produced. finally in the last report  we summarize the major findings and suggest future work on snow\\'s notion of multidimensional achievement test validation.\\nenhanced the predictive validity for science achievement. general ability was the strongest predictor of achievement outcomes whereas motivational variables were the strongest predictors of engagement and choice. general ability had a direct effect on achievement and an indirect effect through the mediation of competence beliefs.\\ncompetence beliefs and task values had direct effects on achievement and indirect effects through the mediation of engagement. the study highlights the differential predictive validity of cognitive and motivational factors for different types of outcome and corroborates the mediational pathways linking self-system processes action and outcomes.\\nin his new aptitude theory snow 1989 snow   1992 as in other areas of academic achievement research on science achievement has focused primarily on the cognitive determinants. undoubtedly intelligence has a significant influence on academic achievement. a vast body of research has provided consistent evidence for the link between iq and academic achievement for reviews see jensen 1998 matarazzo 1972 snow & yalow 1982 . yet as snow recognized cognition alone presents too narrow a view of achievement. first a typical mean correlation between iq and academic achievement reported in the literature is about .50 jensen 1998 . this implies that iq accounts for about 25% of the variance in achievement and that about 75% of the variance is explained by factors other than iq. second research on expertise has provided ample evidence that expert performance is the end result of individuals\\' prolonged efforts to improve performance ericsson & charness 1994 . individual differences in the levels of performance are closely related to the amount of deliberate practice. in a wide range of domains eminent performance requires sustained practice over a minimum of 10 years ericcson & lehman 1996 . third zeal for life-long learning and self-improvement should be regarded as a valued end in itself. an increasingly knowledge-dependent society demands that workers continuously upgrade themselves. the motivation to sustain lifelong pursuit of knowledge beyond the confines of the classroom is as important as if not more important than the acquisition of skills and knowledge.\\nthe limitations of the cognitive view underscore the need for moving beyond cognitive factors in accounting for performance. this study sought to enhance our understanding of conjoint influences of cognitive and motivational factors on academic performance and achievement-related behavior. to this end we drew on several contemporary theories of human ability and motivation to construct our conceptual model.', '1566fa3c-0c67-46c4-97eb-1e95256b800d': 'abstract background: gait speed is an important measure of lower extremity

pronounced trends in higher education over the last decade has been the increased reliance on instructors outside of the traditional full-time ph.d.-trained model. nearly 43 percent of all teaching faculty were part-time in 1998 and at selective colleges graduate assistant instructors teach over 35 percent of introductory courses. critics argue that these alternative instructors with less education and engagement within a university are causing the quality of education to deteriorate and may affect student interest in a subject. however little research exists to document these claims. this paper attempts to fill this void using a unique dataset of students at public four-year colleges in ohio. the paper quantifies how adjunct and graduate assistant instructors affect the likelihood of enrollment and success in subsequent courses. because students with alternative instructors may differ systematically from other students the paper uses two empirical strategies: course fixed effects and a value-added instructor model. the results suggest that adjunct and graduate assistant instructors generally reduce subsequent interest in a subject relative to full-time faculty members

voxel-based irregularity age map iam for brain magnetic resonance image mri to identify white matter hyperintensities wmh on scans with mild vascular pathology. age map is a term used in computer graphic field that reveals age/progression of defected areas in images' texture. in this work age map is used to reveal the age of irregularity of brain tissue i.e. hyperintensities. age map of wmh is useful because it shows not only the probability of voxels to be wmh but also the scale in the progression of voxels to become wmh. our approach is fully automatic and unsupervised with little to none human interaction. we evaluated our approach using brain mri data obtained from the alzheimers disease neuroimaging initiative adni database and visually compared the results with those obtained from the public toolbox lesion segmentation toolbox lst. we also evaluated our proposed approach on images from 10 different subjects using dice similarity coefficient dsc.\\nwhite matter hyperintensities wmh are regions in brain magnetic resonance image mri that appear brighter than the other regions in the t2-fluid attenuation inversion recovery flair mri sequence. wmh are features found in many brain pathologies such as stroke multiple sclerosis ms and dementia/alzheimer's disease ad. specifically it is believed that wmh are associated with the progression of dementia [1] [2] . because of that producing age map of wmh is beneficial and important to track the progression of brain pathologies.\\nin past years there have been many attempts to develop wmh segmentation tools where most of works use machine learning algorithms. support vector machine svm [3]  ran dom forest rf [4] and convolution encoder network cen [5] are some supervised machine learning methods that have been studied for automatically segmenting wmh. however supervised methods are limited to the availability of labelled data which is very time consuming to produce and highly dependent on physician or expert's delineation. to avoid the aforementioned dependencies unsupervised methods have we propose a novel way to extract irregularity age map that shows age of voxels as hyperintensities instead of probability of voxels being hyperintensities. the irregularity age map proposed in this paper is a map where each brain voxel has value from 0 to 1 to indicate a scale in the progression of irregularities i.e. hyperintensities from their minimal up to their maximal intensity degree. in this age map brighter intensities are indicated with higher value i.e. close to 1 than the others i.e. close 0. this differs from probability maps where each voxel has a probability value to indicate whether the voxel is wmh or not. this approach is derived from a previously published computer graphic work [8]  where they extract the age map to indicate weathered area of some texture images.\\nage map calculation and generation have some benefits compared to other approaches. firstly the age map calculation and generation do not need hyperintensities to be labelled which are very tedious and expensive to produce. secondly the age map of mri shows all irregularities inside the brain not only one from a specific brain pathology. in this work we use hyperintensities as irregularities of mr images. however it is possible to generate age maps for different irregularities such as lacunar lesions or traumatic injuries. this paper is organised as follow. section 1 discusses some backgrounds of this study. section 2 discusses related work and overview of our proposed approach. section 3 explains step-by-step on how irregularity age maps are calculated and generated. section 4 and section 5 show some results for visual observation and its discussions. section 6 draws conclusions of this study and some future works.\\nthis work is highly influenced from previous work in computer graphic [8] where authors successfully generate age map from texture images. the main idea of age map is to quantify irregularities on weathered texture images into age values in the range of 0 to 1 where weathered areas i.e. consumed by time and weather are regarded as irregularities\",

coleman et al. 1982b found that both catholic and other private schools exhibited higher student achievement than public schools but private school students showed higher self-esteem and \"sense of

schools varied so widely in purpose size sustainability and other characteristics a limitation also noted by noell 1982 . bryk lee and holland 1993 argue that even if achievement differences are not supported catholic schools serve the common good by producing more than test scores. catholic schools these authors contend are moral communities that emphasize equity and social justice rather than individual selfinterest. in contrast they noted that other private schools serve a greater variety of purposes and a narrower range of students.\\nusing data from the high school effectiveness supplement of the national education longitudinal study of 1988 nels:88 lee et al. 1998 compared math course-taking in public catholic and independent secondary schools and reported that in all private secondary schools students on average take more advanced math courses. catholic schools were especially notable for more math course-taking among a broader range of students. however this study had a limitation in that baseline math scores were unavailable for more than half of the sample. gamoran 1996  in the analysis of urban high schools in the nels:88 found no advantages in achievement in mathematics reading science and social studies for either catholic or secular private high schools compared with public magnet schools. gamoran did not examine the different or similar school characteristics that could influence these student outcomes.\\nbecause previous research did not settle the question of catholic school effectiveness and given the current salience of school

differences are found this study is designed to develop explanations for such institutional effects.\\nhow does this study differ from previous ones? while most previous catholic school studies used public schools as a reference for comparison this study compares catholic schools with non-catholic private schools. such a comparison makes sense because private schools have organizational

capital e.g. network parental involvement in the school community. according to chubb and moe 1990  \"all schools in the private sector have two institutional features in common: society does not

implementation of the hybrid framework using the high school and beyond data set.\\nnonrandom sampling involves selecting units e.g. persons with unknown probabilities of selection from a finite population of units. this finite population may be poorly defined e.g. all persons who saw a flier posted on a community bulletin board or well defined e.g. all children attending licensed daycare centers in dayton ohio. nonrandom or purposive sampling is common in observational psychology research. for example 76% of observational studies according to some psychology research methods texts the answer to the first question is no: \"although these purposive sampling methods are more practical than formal probability sampling they are not backed by a statistical logic that justifies formal generalizations\" shadish cook & campbell 2002 pp. 24 356 see also cook & campbell 1979 pp. 72-73. 1 however according to other psychology research methods texts formal statistical inferences from nonrandom samples are possible under certain conditions e.g. cronbach 1982 pp. 255 158-166.\\nagain consulting psychology research methods texts the answer to the second question remains unclear. for example shadish et al. 2002 note that randomly selecting units-that is sampling units with known probabilities of selection from a well-defined finite population of units-facilitates generalization from those sample units to the finite population by ensuring a \"match between sample and population distributions on measured and unmeasured attributes within known limits of sampling error\" p. 343

different methods of analysis need or can be used with random samples versus nonrandom samples in order to achieve such inference.\\n1 cook and campbell 1979 pp. 72-73 indicate that nonrandom sampling precludes statistical inference which they term strict generalizing from samples to populations. they further state that generalizing from a sample to a population logically presupposes generalizing across subgroups within a population e.g. boys vs. girls. nevertheless because of the rarity of random samples they state that they will deemphasize the first step generalizing to a population to focus on the second step generalizing across subpopulations.\\n2 for this reason shadish et al. 2002 pp. 472-473 state that randomly selecting units facilitates external validity. moreover shadish et al. 2002 pp. 55-56 also imply that random selection would facilitate internal validity by decreasing risk of selection bias defined later. \\nthe first goal of this article is to comprehensively address these two questions by describing alternative inferential frameworks for nonrandom and random samples. to answer the first question we present a model-based statistical framework due originally to ronald fisher for inference from nonrandom or random samples to what we will term infinite populations. we make explicit the statistical logic that allows formal generalization under

of light smokers quit smoking while fewer than 13 percent of heavy smokers quit. there is also movement toward higher levels of smoking in the future among those who were moderate or heavy smokers in the past. 1 in this paper we seek to measure the significance of previous smoking behavior as a causal contributor to smoking persistence. we refer to this possibility as state dependence. for example previous smoking consumption might alter the current utility of different smoking alternatives it might reflect different sensitivities to price or it might impact health that influences the expected value of future smoking alternatives. what we call state dependence is often referred to as addiction.\\n2 however it is also possible that smoking persistence stems largely from individual heterogeneity. individual differences both observed and unobserved may lead some to be prone to smoke and others to abstain. for example health-conscious individuals might never smoke while present-oriented individuals always smoke. these two explanations for persistent behavior are laid out and formalized in heckman 1981 and are now standard terminology in the economics literature. our goal is to determine the importance of state dependence for smoking behavior after extensively controlling for individual heterogeneity.\\nunderstanding the explanations for smoking persistence has important implications for public policy. government taxes continue to be the main policy tool used to lower smoking rates and the average state plus federal tax rate has doubled between 1998 and 2003. the effectiveness of these tax increases in reducing smoking rates over the long run depends crucially on the source of smoking persistence. suppose one's smoking history does alter current choices and that smokers are less price sensitive than nonsmokers a point we document later. taxes are quite powerful in this case: by discouraging some individuals from smoking today they will increase the proportion of relatively more price-sensitive nonsmokers in the future. this compositional change produces a multiplier effect as future taxes become more effective at reducing aggregate smoking rates. alternatively suppose smoking persistence is largely due to individual heterogeneity. in this case taxes are not very powerful. individual factors rather than prices are the primary determinant of current and longrun smoking decisions.\\nwe disentangle the roles of previous smoking behavior and individual heterogeneity that is observed and unobserved individual characteristics in smoking decisions using detailed panel data on u.s. teenagers. the national education longitudinal survey nels follows a representative sample of eighth graders in two-year waves beginning in 1988 and is described in detail in section ii. there are three reasons why we focus on teenagers and use the nels data. first teens are the gilleskie and strumpf 823 1. in addition smoking is initiated at an early age. almost 42 percent of current or former adult smokers start younger than age 16 and 75 percent start younger than age 19 gruber 2001 . although individuals younger than age 18 consume only 2 percent of the total amount of cigarettes smoked in a year in the united states such teen smoking has long-term dynamic implications because youth smoking appears to persist into adulthood u.s. dhhs 1994. 2. we do not use the term addiction since there are many possible sources of state dependent behavior. in addition to the channels listed in the text persistent smoking behavior might reflect convex adjustment costs.\\nfocus of many policy discussions. nels is rather unique because it tracks a wider population than other youth surveys. it includes teens from every state which allows us to utilize price variation in all 50 states and follows school dropouts. second a majority of smokers first try cigarettes when they are teenagers and youth smoking often persists into adulthood. while many other surveys have limited information about smoking initiation which can occur years prior to the first interview and is often only known from retrospective self-reports we accurately observe when smoking begins in our data. this allows us to avoid potentially serious sample selection problems or the need to estimate a simplified reduced-form initial condition equation representing previous smoking behavior. third studying teens provides insights into the state dependence of smoking decisions. we take advantage of the multiple observations per person to account for individual heterogeneity and to determine the extent to which previous smoking behavior causally influences current choices. finding a significant role for past smoking behavior among teens would suggest that smoking even the first short-duration experience can rapidly modify behavior.\\nwe describe our empirical methods in section iii. we jointly estimate a set of equations that capture smoking participation and conditional demand. the empirical model allows previous smokers and nonsmokers to have different tastes for smoking and different price sensitivities. tastes are distinguished by observed characteristics-which include time-varying information on individual demographics parents schools and the community-as well as by unobserved to the econometrician individual heterogeneity that is treated in a general semiparametric fashion. thus the model allows changes or persistence in behavior to be driven by individual heterogeneity as well as by previous smoking choices. we use the discrete factor random effects methodology introduced by heckman and singer 1984 and extended by mroz 1999 . this method allows correlation in unobservables across multiple equations without imposing a distributional form and has been used in a wide variety of empirical applications including health goldman 1995 cutler 1995  welfare participation hoynes 1996  child care blau and hagy 1998 hu 1999  disability insurance kreider and riphahn 2000  and program evaluation angeles et al. 1998 .\\nour estimates are presented in section iv. the results depend crucially on two modeling features: whether individual smoking history is treated as exogenous or endogenous and whether unobserved individual heterogeneity is omitted or included. we find that previous smoking behavior has a causal effect even after allowing for extensive individual differences. for example after controlling for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity smoking lightly in eighth grade as opposed to not smoking doubles the probability of choosing to smoke two years later and smoking participation rates are one-fifth higher four years later. the strong role of previous use is impressive given that the teens in our sample have been smoking for no more than a few years. alternatively if we do not control for the unobserved heterogeneity associated with persistent behavior this effect is biased upward and overstates the role of previous smoking behavior. for example smoking lightly in eighth grade quadruples participation rates two years later and more than doubles them four years later. we also find that previous nonsmokers are more price sensitive than previous smokers with participation price elasticities of −0.48 and −0.16 respectively. our preferred results suggest that prices serve both to reduce consumption of smokers and also to reduce the number of new smokers. alternatively when previous behavior is presumed exogenous prices only affect consumption among smokers. our modeling extensions allow us to simulate the long-run effects of policy changes as the population composition of smokers and nonsmokers is altered. in total a dollar increase in cigarette prices reduces age 18 smoking participation predictions by a third more when unobserved individual heterogeneity and behavior modification are taken into account than when they are ignored.\\nour paper contributes to the large economics literature on cigarette consumption that is reviewed in chaloupka and warner 2001 . to place our methods and results in context we briefly mention here some of the work upon which our paper builds. we focus on papers that use individual-level panel data as opposed to aggregate time series or repeated cross-sections since multiple observations on individuals allow a researcher to disentangle state dependence from individual heterogeneity. we first discuss efforts in the relevant literature to incorporate previous smoking behavior and then the addition of future consumption and prices.\\nto account for the endogeneity of past smoking behavior chaloupka 1991 instruments lagged consumption using several lags of prices and taxes in a two-stage approach. the recently developed estimation strategies that we employ lead to significant efficiency improvements over the instrumental variable approach and its potential weak instrument critique.\\n3 other research that explicitly considers previous smoking behavior focuses only on the decisions to start or stop smoking.\\n4 decicca et al. 2002 also use nels data to determine the immediate effects of prices nontax policies and schooling on the single transition from nonsmoking to smoking among teens. tauras and chaloupka 2001 estimate smoking cessation hazards while douglas 1998 separately estimates smoking initiation and quitting decisions. we unify the approaches in these papers by jointly modeling all decisions that is initiation continuation cessation and relapse and by considering the general impact of previous consumption both participation and intensity on current smoking decisions. this allows us to more broadly understand the role of previous smoking behavior since we study participation of both former nonsmokers and former smokers. continuing to follow all individuals even those changing their behavior permits us to simulate dynamic responses to policy changes. labeaga 1999 has a focus similar to our work. he separately estimates dynamic participation and conditional intensity equations and accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. we disaggregate his results which rely on household rather than individual data and explain expenditures on all tobacco-related products rather than consumption of cigarettes.\\nin addition to dependence on previous smoking decisions theoretical models of smoking behavior suggest that cigarette consumption today also depends on future consumption and future cigarette prices. the rational addiction model becker and murphy 1988 implies that individuals respond to future events. empirical tests of such rational behavior have found that leads of consumption and leads of price are statisti-3. our panel data also provide recent and relatively accurate reports of behavior as opposed to the retrospective data that chaloupka employs. in addition while he includes no controls for unobserved state-level heterogeneity we show that this omission imparts a significant negative bias on price effects. 4. gruber 2001 discusses other recent work on teen smoking behavior. these papers primarily use crosssectional analysis.\\ncally significant predictors of current smoking behavior. 5 we do not include these future variables in our specifications. the empirical rational addiction model assumes these variables are known with perfect foresight. we contend that current behavior is a function of the entire distribution of future values for all consumption options and prices not just those that are observed. these distributions are a function of currently available information potentially including all lags of behavior and prices. our empirical strategy controls for all of these lags. however we cannot test whether future variables matter in a nonstructural framework. our empirical model does not explicitly estimate the underlying preference parameters or how individual expectations are formed and so it is mute about whether there is forward-looking behavior.\\n6 hence one may interpret our model as myopic in the accepted rational addiction framework. we believe that a true test of both the addictive nature of smoking behavior and the rational aspect of behavior requires solution of the individual's forward-looking optimization problem and estimation of the primitives of the model. we do not intend to estimate these structural parameters here and reserve that for future work.\\nour work contributes to the smoking demand literature in two ways. first we provide empirical evidence of state dependence-the statistically significant effect of endogenous previous smoking consumption on current smoking decisions-within a unified framework that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and allows for all possible transitions in behavior. second our work refines long-run simulations of smoking behavior because our predictions reflect the changing composition of smokers and nonsmokers and the subsequent differences in price sensitivities portrayed by these different groups. this approach improves upon long-run predictions that ignore the role of previous behavior presume it is exogenous or loosely proxy for it using instruments. failing to model previous smoking choices precludes measuring the compositional changes in the population over time and hence significantly underestimates the long-run price response.\",

whether a lower psa velocity could identify those men with life-threatening prostate cancer during a window of curability.\\nif men with a relatively high psa velocity in the year before diagnosis are more likely than men with a low psa velocity to have advanced prostate cancer not amenable to cure with surgery it is conceivable that these same men with life-threatening disease could have been

parameters. to demonstrate the process four forecast models in hawaii at hilo kahului honolulu and nawiliwili are described. the models were validated with fourteen historical tsunamis and compared with numerical results from reference inundation models of higher resolution. the accuracy of the modeled maximum wave height is greater than 80% when the observation is greater than 0.5 m when the observation is below 0.5 m the error is less than 0.3 m. the error of the modeled arrival time of the first peak is within 3% of the travel time. the developed forecast models were further applied to hazard assessment from simulated magnitude 7.5 8.2 8.7 and 9.3 tsunamis based on subduction zone earthquakes in the pacific. the tsunami hazard assessment study indicates that use of a seismic magnitude alone for a tsunami source assessment is inadequate to achieve such accuracy for tsunami amplitude forecasts. the forecast models apply local bathymetric and topographic information and utilize dynamic boundary conditions from the tsunami source function database to provide site-and event-specific coastal predictions. only by combining a deep-ocean assessment and reporting of tsunami-constrained tsunami magnitude with site-specific high-resolution models can the forecasts completely cover the evolution of earthquake-generated tsunami waves: generation deep ocean propagation and coastal inundation. wavelet analysis of the tsunami waves suggests the coastal tsunami frequency responses at different sites are dominated by the local bathymetry yet they can be partially related to the locations of the tsunami sources. the study also demonstrates the nonlinearity between offshore and nearshore maximum wave amplitudes.\\ncitation: tang l. v. v. titov and c.

functional brain images are playing an important role in helping us understand the changes associated with neurological disorders such as alzheimer\\'s disease ad. recent efforts have now started investigating their utility for diagnosis purposes. this line of research has shown promising results where methods from machine learning such as support vector machines have been used to identify ad-related patterns from images for use in diagnosing new individual subjects. in this paper we propose a new framework for ad classification which makes use of the linear program lp boosting with novel additional regularization based on spatial \"smoothness\" in 3d image coordinate spaces. the algorithm formalizes the expectation that since the examples for training the classifier are images the voxels eventually selected for specifying the decision boundary must constitute spatially contiguous chunks i.e. \"regions\" must be preferred over isolated voxels. this prior belief turns out to be useful for significantly reducing the space of possible classifiers and leads to substantial benefits in generalization. in our method the requirement of spatial contiguity of selected discriminating voxels is incorporated within the optimization framework directly. other methods have made use of similar biases as a preor post-processing step however our model incorporates this

understanding these struggles in historical context and being clear that it is the enacted thoughts and actions behind the classroom doors that will matter the most if students are to benefit provide an important backdrop for the data we analyze in this study to make a difference.\\nduring the past 100 plus years several critical periods of curriculum reform have brought attention to different focuses for mathematics in the school curriculum. one of those periods occurred at the turn of the 20th century. then like now concerns about immigration dramatic developments in the economy and industry the influence of the subject disciplines such as mathematics and the educational expectations held for different students attending schools arose. these concerns influenced the creation of commissions and study groups during the first two decades of the twentieth century. the commissions considered these factors and developed curricular reforms to respond to those concerns at that time. for example the secondary school curriculum had special relevance as reflected in the work of the committee of ten which began its work in 1892. it was comprised of university presidents and a faculty member principals and the united states commissioner of education. it focused on developing a common curriculum for all students who would attend secondary schools not just the college bound students. as cremin 1955 notes: … its conception of the secondary school is here all-important. the secondary school is viewed as an institution designed to prepare a small segment of american youth \"for the duties of life\" by improving their intellectual abilities. the committee saw absolutely no conflict between this conception and that of the high school as a college-preparatory institution for the task of improving intellectual abilities centered squarely in the studies of the college p. 296.\\nwhile cremin points to the committee of ten\\'s reform in the secondary schools at that time as one about influencing only a small segment of students who would be going onto college there was an indirect expectation that the reform would also influence the intellectual abilities of all students. that twin hopes have remained with us since that time. nonetheless algebra has remained a focus for the small group of college bound students. for example in 1895 the national education association\\'s committee on college entrance requirements recommended algebra as a 9th grade course george 2007 . however since then during the past century and now during the first decade and more of the 21st century efforts have fluctuated between having students focus on the knowledge and skills related to college preparation like algebra and those that would relate directly to student\\'s preparation for life which in turn would advance their knowledge and skills as citizens and in various occupations and careers that students might pursue after high school. for example despite that early effort in 1892 to have algebra as a course for all students schools developed programs in which students\\' focuses in mathematics shifted to more practical matters in courses like business math applied math and others related to arithmetic content for students who were not on a college preparation track. algebra \"for all\" was often dropped and replaced by courses such as general mathematics for students who were not directly college bound tyack & cuban 1995 . as a result in the 1920s participation in algebra had dropped from 57% of students taking algebra in 1910 to only 40% taking algebra in 1922 in ohio for example stanic & kilpatrick 1992 .\\nother subsequent curriculum reform efforts sought more dramatic changes in the secondary school curriculum after that time. for example in the 1930s and into the 1940s the progressive education association undertook the eight-year study. it involved 30 high schools in advancing progressive educational practices. in their study efforts those schools addressed the following concerns about high schools: the lack of purpose limited attention to citizenship and community life the lack of intellectual challenge weak personal connections to students and ineffective classroom learning conditions aiken 1942 .\\nthe remedies that arose in these 30 schools to address these issues can be summed in this way:\\nthe schools [those involved] were confident that this could be done … by basing the secondary school curriculum upon the needs of the youth in our society. if the high school helped students to find the meanings of their life experiences they would go on to college to seek deeper and broader meaning in their maturing experiences. to the end traditional studies would have to be revitalized and reoriented: much new content would have to be included in the curriculum of school and college. … these schools took their eyes off of the college gates and looked to the fruitful fields beyond p. 23.\\nhere again another effort to have a school curriculum do both -have students prepared for college and have a productive life beyond schooling.\\ndespite the success of the schools\\' efforts involved in the eight-year study chamberlin chamberlin drought & scott 1942  eventually national attention then turned to advancing \"life adjustment\" goals related to and different in degree from the efforts in the 30 schools of the eight-year study. these reforms emphasized \"active and creative achievements as well as an adjustment to existing conditions it places a high premium upon learning to make wise choices since the very concept of american democracy demands the appropriate revising of aims and the means of attaining them\" cremin 1964 p. 336 . while the life adjustment curriculum succeeded in gaining attention and implementation in many schools in the country it too waned under predictable criticisms revolving around the abandonment of conventional subjects and courses cremin 1964 p. 339 . yet as before algebra and similar courses prevailed for those going to college. for those not going on to college the debate continued. on what should these students focus with respect to mathematics in high school?\\nfor example in 1957 sputnik was launched into the sky and on the horizon a new focus for mathematics reform -an update to the mathematics and science curriculum so that the united states would overtake the perceived technological superiority of the soviet union. yet even before the launch of sputnik during the 1950s university mathematicians worked again to rethink school mathematics and involve themselves in school mathematics curriculum reform. max beberman for example created the new math with his colleagues on the university of illinois committee on school mathematics uicsm. like the school mathematics study group smsg that followed uicsm it focused on algebra and the integration of concepts like \"structure and proof in algebra\" \"treatment of inequalities along with equations\" and \"integrated algebra and trigonometry\" into the school mathematics program herrera & owens 2001 . these refocuses would create a pathway to college and college preparation as well as success in mathematics for other students to benefit them beyond schooling stanic & kilpatrick 1992 .\\nuniversity mathematicians in particular once again entered the arena of curriculum reform attempting to bridge the gap between the existing school mathematics\\' curriculum and the discipline of mathematics underway in universities. attention to the interests of university mathematicians moved reform in mathematics farther away from methods of learning and the centrality of students as expressed in the curriculum being advanced in the eight-year study and the life adjustment movements during the 1930s and 1940s. it again re-emphasized mathematics\\' content and courses. stanic and kilpatrick 1992 explains this rejection of the earlier curriculum changes and the responses to sputnik in this way: … a previous overemphasis on method was by many held responsible for the neglect of content because the university mathematicians who dominated the modern mathematics movement tended to be specialists in pure rather than applied mathematics they saw pure mathematics with an emphasis on set theory and axiomatics not only as the content that was missing from the school curriculum but also as providing the framework around which to reorganize that curriculum p. 412.\\nthis refocus on the discipline of mathematics did not persist for too long or affect much of life behind classroom doors in mathematics for students or teachers goodlad klein & associates 1970 . the advocacy for basic skills for most students had returned this time in the form of competency-based education cooney 1988 . by the 1970s the new curriculum manifestations of the discipline of mathematics focused only on the gifted and advanced students. for all other students general mathematics and basic skills remained the menu of the day. tracking was fully embraced with differentiated educational goals and curriculum being enacted for students with different backgrounds and experience oakes 1985 oakes 1990 oakes and guiton 1995 ravitch 2000 .\\nafter the mid-1980s a nation at risk became the policy reform text of the day despite consisting of fewer than 25 pages of analysis and recommendations. nevertheless it called for educational reforms for achieving a more competitive stance towards other nations similar to the responses that arose in the late 50\\'s to the orbiting sputnik satellite the national commission on excellence in education 1983. mathematicians again entered the educational reform scene emphasizing this time the ways of knowing in the academic discipline of mathematics and adding attention to insights from cognitive sciences for a more powerful kind of mathematics learning for all students.\\nin 1989 the national council of teachers of mathematics nctm as a result of the \"standards movement \" which grew out of a nation at risk decided to use its own organizational resources to draft a set of standards determined by the profession -mathematics educators in p-12 university level mathematicians teacher educators and practicing teachers to name a few of the interests involved. as a result of their work they produced an enumeration of standards for practice. at least two other documents articulating related standards for teaching and standards for assessment emerged in 1991 and 1995 hiebert 1999 .\\nthese efforts established a set of goals for mathematics education. the goals centered on several emotional and conative aspects of learning in mathematics -valuing mathematics and having confidence in undertaking mathematical thinking and problem solving. the remaining goals centered on the qualities of problem solving and reasoning as mathematicians accompanied with the skill of communicating clearly as a mathematician about these qualities. romberg 1992 notes the intended focus of classroom learning for students: …encourage them to value the mathematical enterprise to develop mathematical habits of mind and to understand and appreciate the role of mathematics in human affairs that they should be encouraged to explore to guess and even to make and correct errors so that they gain confidence in their ability to solve complex problems that they should read write and discuss mathematics and that they should conjecture test and build arguments about a conjecture\\'s validity. the opportunity for all students to experience these components of mathematical training is at the heart of our vision of a quality mathematics program p. 424.\\nlike other mathematics\\' curriculum reform efforts during the century this one too sought these focuses in order to accomplish the twin goals of preparing students for college and advancing student success beyond their school years. as before critical reactions followed. the evidence suggested that having these goals enacted in classrooms was not a foregone conclusion herrera & owens 2001 . but having all students attend to a mathematics that would do both -advance college preparation and life preparationfollowed as the 20th century came to a close.\\nfor example in 1994 the new york city public school system decided that all of its 9th grade students would take algebra as part of a college preparation curriculum bradley 1994 . the chicago public schools followed in 1997 with a similar requirement viadero 2009 . other national groups have also agreed with this emphasis on college preparation mathematics and science. for example the college board\\'s \"equity 2000\" program expands algebra courses to high school freshmen nationwide 2000 . after 2000 when the california legislature passed a bill senate bill 1354 requiring high school candidates for graduation to successfully complete an algebra course california education code section 51224.5 algebra became a required course for all california high school graduation candidates.\\nalgebra is now widely considered to be a gateway course for college preparation riley 1997 moses kamii

cancer screening. the results of the systematic reviews were evaluated by the acs prostate cancer advisory committee and deliberations about the evidence occurred at committee meetings and during

there remain significant uncertainties regarding the overall value of detecting prostate cancer early. emerging evidence that periodic testing with prostate-specific antigen psa may reduce the likelihood of dying from prostate cancer must be weighed against the serious risks against this backdrop of uncertainties risks and potential benefits we have developed a guideline that accentuates the importance of involving men in the decision whether to initiate and continue testing for prostate cancer. to engage in this decision men must have a basic understanding of the importance of prostate cancer the potential benefits of early detection the strengths and limitations of psa testing and the risks of finding and treating screen-detected cancer. in the guideline statement we have attempted to provide the core elements of information necessary for an informed decision. how men use this knowledge will depend heavily on the value they place on the various elements: is the opportunity to potentially lower a man's probability of dying from cancer worth the risk of deleterious effects of treatment? does the realization that some men are treated unnecessarily outweigh the reassurance that comes from finding cancer at an early stage? health care providers can and should play a critical role in helping men to make this decision by assuring that they have adequate information and by helping them to clarify their values relevant to the decision. given the complexity of the issues involved and the time constraints faced by health care providers we encourage providers and patients to use prostate cancer screening decision aids to facilitate the process and better ensure a decision that is truly commensurate with the patient's values. for men who are unable to decide the screening decision can be left to the discretion of the health care provider who should factor into the decision his or her knowledge of the patient's general health preferences and values.\\nin view of the delay between diagnosis through screening and the expected mortality benefit we continue to recommend that men whose life expectancy is less than 10 years not pursue prostate cancer early detection. the likelihood of benefit in these men is sufficiently low to be outweighed by the risk of harms stemming from treatment which will be experienced in the near term. conversely we continue to recommend that men at higher risk for developing prostate cancer at earlier ages-african american men and men with a family history of prostate cancer in nonelderly relatives-be provided the opportunity for informed decision making at an earlier age than average-risk men.\\nfor providers and their patients who choose to be tested we offer guidance regarding the frequency of testing based on the psa level and on how to act on the testing result. lacking definitive answers from randomized trials we consider the traditional psa level of 4.0 ng/ml a reasonable threshold for further evaluation. however acknowledging that there is no true psa cutoff point distinguishing cancer from noncancer we suggest that providers consider individualized decision making when psa levels fall in the indeterminate range of 2.5 ng/ml to 4.0 ng/ml particularly for men at increased risk for high-grade cancer based on non-psa risk factors.\\nwe are hopeful that future advances in the early detection of prostate cancer will lead to the ability to distinguish accurately between indolent and aggressive cancers and that the adverse effects of prostate cancer treatment will be reduced sufficiently to tip the balance clearly in favor of screening. until then however it will remain incumbent on health care providers and the health care system as a whole to provide men

small-scale sediment transport processes and large-scale geologic oceanographic and morphologic processes. improved understanding of coastal behavior at multiple time scales is required for refining models that predict potential erosion hazards and for coastal management planning and decision-making. here we investigate the primary controls on shoreline response along a geologically-variable barrier island on time scales resolving extreme storms and decadal variations over a period of nearly one century. an empirical orthogonal function analysis is applied to a time series of shoreline positions at fire island ny to identify patterns of shoreline variance along the length of the island. we establish that there are separable patterns of shoreline behavior that represent response to oceanographic forcing as well as patterns that are not explained by this forcing. the dominant shoreline behavior occurs over large length scales in the form of alternating episodes of shoreline retreat and advance presumably in response to storms cycles. two secondary responses include long-term response that is correlated to known geologic variations of the island and the other reflects geomorphic patterns with medium length scale. our study also includes the response to hurricane sandy and a period of post-storm recovery. it was expected that the impacts from hurricane sandy would disrupt long-term trends and spatial patterns. we found that the response to sandy at fire island is not notable or distinguishable from several other large storms of the prior decade.\\npublished by

interact with the launch vehicle control system and cause unpredicted motions and reactions. likewise spacecraft control systems and sensors can be influenced by sloshing fuel or by fuel simply not being in the expected center of gravity location. slosh effects can be categorized in two additional ways. the first deals with slosh caused by launch vehicle and spacecraft maneuvers and if induced under an acceleration field is usually some type of bulk fluid motion with a periodic component. the second is slosh induced by interaction with a spinning or rotating spacecraft. this type of slosh can be bulk fluid motion and/or subsurface wave motion currents and almost always is periodic because of the spin. in either case an unpredicted coupled resonance between the vehicle or spacecraft and the on board fuel can have mission threatening affects. for example missions have been lost because of uncontrolled growth in nutation driven by resonant fuel slosh. ' this paper describes the on-going research effort to improve the accuracy and efficiency of modeling techniques used to predict these types of motions. in particular a comparison of some of the preliminary results with and without diaphragms is made to illustrate the effect of diaphragms and bladders on the slosh dynamics.\\nhistorically it has been possible to predict free-surface lateral slosh of bulk fluid motion with a great deal of confidence and accuracy using codes such as the lomens and the dodge programs. 2 the difficulty increases and the confidence will diminish when a diaphragm or a bladder is introduced into a fuel tank. these devices are used to separate the fuel from the gas tillage usually pressurized so as to ensure a pure liquid flow to the spacecraft engines. they have become very popular with spacecraft designers since they can guarantee smooth engine performance in any orientation and gravity field or lack thereof. they also do a very good job of ensuring that a very high percentage of the available fuel is utilized. both the lomens and dodge codes assume a pendulum as a mechanical analog for the slosh motion. additional types of mechanical analogs such as rotors and suspended masses are being considered to develop a more generalized method of modeling fuel motion.\\nnasa's launch services program at kennedy space center has developed several launch vehicle dynamic simulations that use parameters derived from these full scale tank tests. these simulations are based on the matlab simmechanics toolbox from mathworks inc. 3 the basic mechanical analog used to date has been the pendulum for bulk slosh with rotors added when needed to account for subsurface rotational waves. simmechanics provides a library of masses joints actuators and sensors and can be used to quickly build up a large variety of different mechanical representations of the fluid motion.\\non-going research effort is aimed at developing a method whereby the parameters can be derived directly from an arbitrary matlab simmechanics model of the mechanical analogs using the parameter estimator toolbox.\\n6 and 7• it has been found that the diaphragm shape can profoundly affect slosh behavior and that surprisingly many of these diaphragms will hold their initial shape throughout launch vibration and maneuvers. 8 extensive analysis has been done on the different tank shapes and locations as well as the use of pmds. a summary of this analysis like that reported by hubert 9 shows the vast differences in possible behaviors of different designs. for example a number of relatively simple mechanical models have been developed for cylindrical tanks with hemispherical end-caps mounted outboard of the spin axis. this type of tank has been popular in a number of spacecraft programs. hubert also notes that one of the most difficult aspects of employing such mechanical models is in the selection of appropriate parameters in the model.\\none of the most practical types of spacecraft propulsion fluid control devices has proven to be the diaphragm which uses an elastomeric material to create an effective barrier between the pressurant gas and the liquid propellant. main advantages of currently available diaphragms over other pmds are that they are easier to manufacture and they are light weight.'° hopefully future diaphragms will be able to collapse in a more repeatable folding pattern. this will further reduce the variability in finding spacecraft fuel slosh parameters and give a more certain location of the fuel tank and hence

launching a project that in a little over a decade would bring humankind to walk on the moon. while every american watched the unfolding of this adventure into outer space with enthusiasm and trepidation scientists at the national institutes of health nih were beginning a different journey perhaps less glamorous and far from the clamor of the media but certainly no less important for humankind.\\nthat same momentous year the foundation for another milestone was being poured when nathan shock william w. peter and arthur norris at the national institute on aging advanced the idea that the aging process would be better understood by studying the same individuals throughout their life span collecting serial assessments at multiple time points rather than by comparing individuals of different ages who may have been exposed to different historical events and environmental conditions. although the idea of longitudinal study was not completely new it was the first time that it was applied to the study of aging. the nih group called for volunteers to join the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa remain in the study throughout the rest of their lives and donate their bodies to science after their death. while today this study design appears straightforward in 1958 the notion of following individuals for life to study aging was an extraordinary leap forward in the field a jump that would transform aging research forever. although questions about the nature of the aging process are probably as old as humankind never before had anyone postulated that chronological and biological age could be dissected and that aging and pathology may evolve along separate although somewhat parallel pathways. today 50 years later the blsa is one of the largest and longest-running longitudinal studies of aging in the united states and is still addressing the same question. what a vision! over many years the blsa has made major contributions to our understanding of normal aging in humans.\\ni cannot even begin to summarize here the fruits of 50 years of labor hundreds of scientific publications and generous contributions of more than 3000 participants. this is common knowledge. data from the blsa have helped scientists explore age-associated changes in anatomical integrity and function across all physiological systems including musculoskeletal cardiovascular endocrine and renal just to name a few examples 1 2 3 4 . by analyzing long-term personality data blsa scientists were able to refute the popular belief that as people age they become irritable and sad and found that in fact personality doesn't change much after puberty 1 5 . by exploring how the ability to think learn and remember changes over time in specific blsa participants scientists were able to show that those who experienced an accelerated decline in memory verbal intelligence and executive function were more likely to develop dementia 6 . above all the blsa indicated that although aging and longevity are affected by genetic factors the quality of our own aging is strongly affected by following a few simple rules such as watching our weight and waist eating a healthy diet exercising regularly and maintaining an active role in society 1 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 .\\ncuriously the blsa has both rewarded and in some sense disappointed the scientists who designed it. there is absolutely no doubt that most of the deterioration in physiological physical and cognitive function that occurs in many aging individuals is attributable to disease suggesting that perhaps aging and diseases evolve along separate biological paths. however as medical technology has advanced and measurement tools have become more precise and accurate the line of demarcation between aging and disease has started to blur 2 . subtle structural and functional changes that previously escaped the ''pathology'' filter are now considered subclinical risk factors for diseases 17 18 19 . we are discovering that aging is a progressive dysregulation of our homeostatic network and that life is maintained owing to the incredible adaptability and resiliency that the network allows at all levels of integration from mitochondrial function to societal and community adaptations. this circuitry of signals receptors and effectors is extremely complex because of the need to detect and characterize thousands of different stressors and build the most effective rapid and parsimonious homeostatic response 20 . there is evidence that with aging this homeostatic network undergoes a progressive simplification and tends to generate responses that are more stereotypic more costly and less effective 21 22 . we also are starting to realize that the dysfunction of the homeostatic network can be detrimental to health. for example the chronic mild proinflammatory state progressive insulin resistance and reduced walking speed which commonly affect older persons have been interpreted as compensatory responses but are also important determinants of pathology. if the dysfunction of the homeostatic network is the primary cause of increased susceptibility to disease then the distinction between aging and pathology while still conceptually valid is almost impossible to detect empirically and certainly cannot be summarized by a few single measures. perhaps this is why in spite of considerable resources the search for unique ''biomarkers of aging'' has so far been extremely disappointing.\\na possible alternative to looking for specific biomarkers of aging is to search for an ''aging signature'' a tag for individuals with age-associated accelerated decline in function across multiple physiological systems. although at first glance this approach may seem unfamiliar it is in fact consistent with the conceptualization of ''frailty'' a syndrome that involves multiple physiological systems that is widely acknowledged in the geriatric literature. scientists have even suggested that the number of systems involved is a measure of frailty severity and clinical progression 23 24 . according to this view expressions such as ''aging brain'' or ''aging heart'' are meaningful only in the context of their contribution to the aging of the whole individual. when deterioration occurs in isolated systems it should be considered in the realm of pathology.\\nthe conceptualization of frailty has contributed substantially to the description of the aging phenotype and its relevance to clinical practice. however i have never been keen on the idea that frailty could be identified by simply ''counting'' affected systems. if we hope to someday decelerate aging and reduce the burden of disease and disability in older individuals the only reasonable choice is to hunt for biological mechanisms and target them for treatment. what we need is a global theory that links together factors that both contribute to and participate in ''accelerated aging.'' when i became the director of the blsa in september 2002 i realized that in spite of the available wealth of data specimens and long-term followup i could not address the ''homeostatic theory of aging'' in the current blsa design. in the mind of nathan shock and of most scientists who worked with him and after him the blsa constituted a recruitment core of volunteers for a number of unconnected longitudinal studies that targeted different aspects of the aging process. although dr. shock acknowledged that the rate of aging may be parallel across different physiological systems and organs this idea was never implemented in the study design. a substantial change in the design was required.\\nduring my first 3 months at blsa i could not sleep. i felt like an inexperienced restorer asked to retouch a painting from giotto or masaccio. i wanted to continue the original blsa mission of studying the aging process at the interface between aging and disease but i also wanted to incorporate the emerging idea that aging is progressive dysfunction in some basic homeostatic mechanism whose effect is minimized by a full range of compensatory strategies.\\nfortunately or unfortunately. . .only time will tell i was working with a group of extraordinarily talented scientists and with their help i was able to overcome my fear. the new scientific paradigm implemented in the blsa was developed from a clinical protocol originally aimed at assessing geriatric patients with mobility problems in the geriatric hospital where i had worked in italy. studies have demonstrated that performance in mobility is a marker of health status superior to any other biomedical measure and one of the main determinants of quality of life in old age. studies have also shown that poor lower extremity performance is a robust predictor of multiple negative health outcomes including disability health care resources utilization nursing home admission and mortality. in spite of this evidence i believe that poor lower extremity performance is not the direct cause of such adverse outcomes but rather a strong marker of homeostatic derangement and deteriorated health which are the true causes of many adverse outcomes.\\nbecause of the critical role that bipedal mobility played in human evolution it is reasonable to assume that a number of compensatory strategies have been evolutionarily selected to maintain mobility despite considerable impairment. decline in mobility only occurs after compensations fail. thus mobility may be interpreted as an overall measure of homeostatic stability and understanding the causes of mobility disability may help explain the homeostatic disruption that occurs with aging.\\nthe new blsa study paradigm is illustrated in figure 1 . on the right side of the figure is mobility the key outcome measure. in the middle are physiological domains that are relevant for mobility. in brief the central nervous system generates the motivation for mobility and also creates refines and provides feedback to motor programs wired through the peripheral nervous system. muscles are effectors that move bones and joints. mobility requires that energy be generated transported and delivered locally and that somatosensory systems provide continuous feedback from the environment. the hypothesis underlying this paradigm is that mobility problems in older persons result from impairment in multiple physiological domains even when the clinical presentation suggests one precipitating cause. on the left side of the figure is a first attempt to identify the essential elements of the homeostatic network. we have hypothesized that the aging process affects multiple physiological systems in parallel harmonically because the signaling network that maintains a stable homeostasis and adequate distribution/utilization of energy becomes progressively less efficient and less able to adapt to stress with aging. the primary elements required for energy generation are provided by nutrition in this context oxygen is considered a nutrient. most energy expenditure is accounted for by resting metabolic rate and physical activity. the production of energy during aerobic metabolism generates reactive oxygen species ros oxidative stress that are scavenged by antioxidant mechanisms. a dynamic stability of the internal environment is maintained by the combined effects of hormones and the autonomic nervous system. finally the integrity of the ''self'' is maintained by the immune system through inflammatory processes. although it is useful to discuss these homeostatic systems separately they appear to belong to the same signaling network and function in a very integrated way 25 .\\nhopefully the systems biology approach implemented in the blsa will tear the seals from the well-concealed mysteries of aging. in the past geriatrics broke new ground when the field identified integrated whole-body functions as an important complement to disease nosology as a way to understanding aging. however while functional assessment offered new and successful management approaches we lacked an understanding of the pathophysiology of disability and therefore we could not fully exploit the profound biological implications of our discovery. the result was that geriatrics became somewhat marginalized within the greater culture of medicine. the outstanding research of the last decade has definitively overthrown this limitation. rather than considering aging as an accumulation of somewhat unrelated individual disease processes observational studies are uncovering common underlying processes that manifest across multiple body systems. these shared mechanisms modulate disease susceptibility and therefore are potential novel targets for prevention and treatment of age-related problems. this unique emerging body of knowledge has implications for future research the

with good health and functioning until near the end of life is the goal of most individuals. finding ways to promote this condition is the raison d'être of aging research. although research has been done on the correlates of long life and functional decline we still know relatively little about why certain individuals live in excellent health into their 80s while others fail much sooner. to address this important question the blsa has launched the project ideal insight into the determinants of exceptional aging and longevity. over the next 5 years the blsa will be enrolling several hundred exceptionally long-lived healthy and high-functioning individuals. these extremely rare subjects are living proof that longevity combined with good health is possible. studying them in comparison to individuals born in the same period but who experience the diseases and functional decrements that occur in most aging individuals may help identify the critical elements required for aging successfully. the rapidly increasing number of long-lived healthy individuals deserves to know what they can do to avoid or delay sickness and functional decline as long as possible. unfortunately there is no certainty that the preventive strategies that were developed for the general population will work in these very special individuals. we are confident that the ideal project will shed some light on these issues.\\nlooking ahead it is fun to fantasize about what we will learn in the next round of discoveries from the blsa. the possibilities are so large that my head spins.

yet little research evaluates how students actually formulate their educational expectations. status attainment theory asserts that students adopt their educational expectations early based on family background and social influences and that their educational expectations are driven by a static mental construct as a result. in contrast recent research based on bayesian learning theory hypothesizes that students mostly adapt their educational expectations in light of new information about their academic potential. comparing models of expectations formation in adolescence we find that students' expectations do not derive from a static mental construct. however students adapt their educational expectations only modestly and only in response to very large changes in grade point averages. thus adolescent educational expectations stabilize early and are rather persistent over time.\\nin an oft-cited work gambetta 1987 poses the question: are students pushed into their educational attainments by aggregate social influences or do they jump into these attainments by their own purposive choice? this question encapsulates an on-going debate in sociology about the extent to which individuals are cognizant agents who strategically act to achieve well-formulated objectives -educational or otherwise -or to which individuals are passive agents who follow structural paths laid out before them with little strategic reflection. in this article we evaluate the general question of how individuals do or do not make decisions taking gambetta's original emphasis on students' educational attainments and using measures of educational expectations as our starting point. educational expectations are an important part of gambetta's push-jump debate about educational decision making despite their wide use little research evaluates how students actually formulate their educational expectations. recent research drawing on bayesian learning theory posits that high school students adapt their expected future educational attainment based on new and pertinent information and more importantly that it is this adaptation process that dominates educational expectation formation morgan 2005 . this argument is in stark contrast to the status attainment tradition which asserts that individuals' educational expectations are largely adopted from significant social others stabilize early in the educational career and therefore indicate a static achievement motivation construct haller 1982 . this most recent iteration of the debate about the nature of decision making in education can be thought of as the adopt-adapt debate: while traditional sociological models on the topic assert students adopt educational expectations early on from social influences determined by their social backgroundexpectations that they internalize as static mental states by adolescence recent work asserts that students mostly adapt their expectations for future education based on new and pertinent information. each position recognizes expectation formation as a nuanced process including both adoption of significant others' expectations and selfreflective adaptation processes like those highlighted in bayesian learning theory but nonetheless each emphasizes adoption or adaptation as the dominant mechanism of expectation formation. 1 the adopt-adapt debate provides a powerful impetus for reexamining how we think about educational expectation formation and ultimately educational decision making. the literature to date provides little empirical evidence as to the relative importance of adoption and adaptation processes in educational expectation formation and important questions remain over which process if either dominates expectation formation as a result. in this research we assess the adopt-adapt debate by modeling how adolescent students formulate their expectations about their educations. we begin with morgan's 2005 recent work on adaptation in educational expectations. given morgan's argument we limit our evaluation to whether students' educational expectations are the result of some static mental construct regardless of its theorized source the extent to which students' educational expectations are stable or persistent over time and the extent to which students adapt their educational expectations over time in light of new information about their academic performances. to preview our findings students do not derive their expectations from a static latent mental state as status attainment theory suggests but neither do they readily adapt their educational expectations in the face of new and pertinent information about their academic performances. students' expectations are highly persistent over time and if students do revise their expectations they do so by a modest amount and based on rather large changes 498 • social forces 902 in their grade point averages. the relative inertia in educational expectations means that

near or greater than 1000 years. however the brevity of tide gauge records result in significant uncertainties when estimating the uniqueness of such an event. here we compare resultant deposition by hurricane sandy to earlier storm-induced flood layers in order to extend records of flooding to the city beyond the instrumental dataset. inversely modeled storm conditions from grain size trends show that a more compact yet more intense hurricane in 1821 ce probably resulted in a similar storm tide and a significantly larger storm surge. our results indicate the occurrence of additional flood events like hurricane sandy in recent centuries and highlight the inadequacies of the instrumental record in estimating current flood risk by such extreme events.\\no n october 29 2012 hurricane sandy inundated new york city ny raising water levels to 3.4 m above 2012 mean sea level msl at the battery located at the south end of lower manhattan. the return period of this storm tide is estimated to be 1570 years based on generalized extreme value return curves from existing tide gauge data 1  and simulated hurricane climatology ranks this storm as a 1-in-900 year event 2 . however tide gauge data alone is generally too short to either obtain accurate extreme value statistics or evaluate the skill of extreme flood probabilities derived solely from numerical simulations 3 . thus there is a real need for longer flood reconstructions particularly for critically important coastlines like new york city. historical documentation of storm activity for the city i.e. newspapers nautical logs etc. can extend storm records back to the mid-1600s for the u.s. east coast [4] [5] [6] [7] . while these records provide valuable information on the occurrence of storms detailed quantitative information on specific storm characteristics prior to 1844 8 is limited particularly with respect to flood magnitudes.\\nstorm surge and storm tide are two separate metrics that describe the storm-induced rise in water levels. storm surge is the anomalous rise in water level above the predicted astronomical tide excluding the impacts of waves and storm tide is the total rise in water level due to the combination of storm surge and astronomical tides. hurricane sandy's peak hourly averaged water levels occurred at high tide at the battery with a storm tide of 3.4 m above 2012 msl and a storm surge of 2.8 m. peak monthly water levels verified by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa extend back to 1927 ce and with the merging of an additional nearby tide gauge provide a reconstruction of peak annual flood heights at the battery back to 1893 ce 9 . hurricane sandy's storm tide exceeded past maxima in these records by over 1 meter hurricane donna's 1960 ce storm tide held the previous record at 2.3 m.\\nsandy's storm surge was also record breaking but to a lesser degree exceeding the previous maxima in the vetted noaa data set by roughly 40 cm the great appalachian storm of 1950 was the previous storm surge of record at 2.4 m. a more recent analysis of archived tide gauge data from the new york city area extends storm tide and storm surge records for the battery back to 1844 and 1860 ce respectively 8  with hurricane sandy remaining the event of record in both.\\nwhile hurricane sandy was record breaking compared to published tide gauge records earlier historical accounts suggest that a major hurricane in 1821 ce may have had a similar storm tide and a substantially larger storm surge 5 7 . during this 1821 hurricane the new bedford mercury newspaper reported a rise in water of 13 feet 4 inches or 4.06 m above low water in the east river 4 6 . the 1821 hurricane struck new york city at low tide with roughly 4.0 to 4.1 m of storm surge compared to sandy's 2.8 m of storm surge. assuming this account is referenced to near the battery a 4.0 m storm surge would far exceed all events recorded within the instrumental tide gauge record including hurricane sandy. other flood descriptions support the 1821 hurricane as a significant flood event including a 10 foot 3.0 m rise in water level at pungoteague va 5  drift caught in the trees 9 feet 2.7 m above the ground at cape may nj 5  and a tide several feet above normal at new london ct 6 . because peak flooding for the 1821 hurricane occurred at low tide its storm tide was smaller than its overall surge. ref. 7 estimated a storm tide of roughly 3.2 m for the event which is slightly less than that observed for hurricane sandy at 3.4 m.\\nproxy records of extreme storm surge such as overwash deposits preserved in coastal ponds and marshes provide the opportunity for an independent assessment of early historical flood events [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . specific to the new york city region ref. 7 developed a proxy record of hurricane flooding just to the east of the city using dated storm deposits preserved within a series of back-barrier saltmarshes in western long island. this reconstruction contained evidence of four significant flood events within the early historic period that were attributed to hurricane strikes in 1693 1788 1821 and 1893. sedimentary reconstructions from the central coast of new jersey contain evidence for the 1821 event and/or a hurricane in 1788 but no deposits associated with the 1893 and 1693 hurricanes 18 . the lack of evidence regarding a significant 1893 flood for new york city is also consistent with the recent analysis of archived tide gauge data 8  which when combined with the long island and new jersey storm proxies suggest that the 1893 flood event may have been focused farther to the east along long island.\\ndiscrepancies between archived tide gauge data in new york harbor and the dated 1893 storm deposits on long island highlight the need for flood reconstructions obtained directly from new york harbor itself. furthermore an important component to any paleostorm reconstruction is the ability to sample and analyze a modern deposit laid down by an event of known intensity. derived sedimentary proxies of hurricane overwash from the modern sandy layer therefore are extremely valuable for improved identification and analyses of older storm deposits preserved in the region. towards this end we present here the first sedimentary reconstruction of significant flooding in new york harbor based on event deposits preserved within a back-barrier pond on staten island and informed with recent deposition in 2012 by hurricane sandy.\\nlocal geology and field site. staten island one of the five boroughs of new york city is located along the west side of new york harbor fig. 1a . proper interpretations of overwash deposition on the island require some background on its glacial legacy. the harbor hill terminal moraine which forms the island's southwestern coast was deposited during the last glacial maximum and marks the southernmost extent of the laurentide ice sheet 19 fig. 1b . grain sizes within the harbor hill moraine are poorly sorted ranging in size from clay to boulder. most of the fine grains within this reddishbrown till which gets its distinctive color from an abundance of hematite are derived from the triassic ''red beds'' located directly to the north 20 . seguine pond is a small 1.2 m deep coastal back-barrier pond on the southern coast of staten island fig. 1c . the pond occupies a narrow drowned fluvial valley that cuts through the terminal moraine. a small 250 m long barrier beach roughly 1-2 m in height forms the southern shore of the pond and separates it from the open waters of lower new york bay. this 20-40 m wide barrier beach is secured in place on either end by two coastal bluffs composed of glacial till. the barrier is fairly uniform in height with the exception of a narrow 5 m wide topographic low at its eastern end which serves as an occasional freshwater outlet for the pond.\\na small stream network drains into the north side of the pond with a total catchment area of roughly 1 sq. km 21 . the seguine catchment is currently composed primarily of lowland suburban terrain draining initially into conservation marshlands. these wetlands are interrupted by a series of deeper natural kettle and artificial retention ponds which both provide internal sediment traps that likely limit stream-borne fluxes directly into seguine pond.\", '4a7d93a3-7396-471b-9a9c-8bbe12ec8b72': \"abstract this paper examines the effects of pre-entry coaching both in terms of money and efforts on achievement of russian high school

hurricanes and other severe storms have proven themselves to be one of the major threats to transportation assets throughout the world particularly to bridges located along coastal areas. bridges as key components of transportation networks have shown to be vulnerable to hurricane-induced wave and surge forces. a large number of bridges along the u.s. gulf coast suffered severe damage from recent hurricanes. current risk-assessment practices include the fragility analysis of bridges based on a single hazard intensity parameter such as peak ground acceleration. however this study investigates the vulnerability of highway bridges against hurricanes for multiple hazard parameters not including the risk of substructure failure due to scour and/or erosion. the proposed hurricane vulnerability assessment methodology is applied to bridges along the surge-prone coastal regions of the state of georgia. the surge-prone region is identified by the usgs slosh maps and vulnerable bridges are selected based on the available nbi database. nonlinear bridge models have been developed to apply a time history of wave loading as a function of the wind speed and storm water depth. different combinations of bridge geometric and material parameters are generated to develop meta-models which cover a wide range of bridge configurations and wave/surge loads. this study yields a fragility function which describes the probability of failure for vulnerable bridges in terms of two environmental parameters: wind speed and storm water depth. the findings of this study will ultimately be

lowdimensional manifold of an image allows for easier statistical comparisons between groups and the synthesis of group representatives. previous studies have sought to identify the best mapping of brain mri to a low-dimensional manifold but have been limited by assumptions of explicit similarity measures. in this work we use deep learning techniques to investigate implicit manifolds of normal

the unsupervised synthesis of t1-weighted brain mri using a generative adversarial network gan by learning from 528 examples of 2d axial slices of brain mri. synthesized images were first shown to be unique by performing a crosscorrelation with the training set. real and synthesized images were then assessed in a blinded manner by two imaging experts providing an image quality score of 1-5. the

climate of collegiality and empowerment in catholic schools the rand study\\'s focus on clarity of mission and local ownership by educators students and parents and bryk lee and holland\\'s emphasis on catholic schools as \"voluntary communities.\" likewise there is a familiarity with a variety of studies that provide specific data on the academic achievement of catholic school students. most notable are the studies based on three national databases: high school and beyond the national assessment of educational progress and the national education longitudinal study. finally practitioners are aware of greeley mccready and mccourt\\'s research and of ncea\\'s research report. the heart of the matter that demonstrated the positive effects of attending a catholic school on adult practice of one\\'s faith.\\nmuch of the credit for practitioners\\' familiarity with the above-mentioned research is owed to the national catholic educational association\\'s ncea publication of research summaries prepared by john convey in numerous issues of ncea notes. likewise articles written by peter benson and others published in ncea\\'s momentum^ also provide the practitioner with summaries of the research on academic achievement and religious effects. in the past year the popular media including newsweek u. s. news and world report the wall street journal time cbs evening news and good morning america have given a significant amount of attention to studies which highlight the effectiveness of catholic schools.\\nhowever familiarity with the research findings does not automatically translate into using research to inform policy and practice. in the case of the research described above these studies serve to affirm the work that catholic schools are doing and practitioners value that affirmation. still these studies describe practices that are already in place in catholic schools and thus they reinforce policy and practice but do not shape new policy or practice.\\nthen what research does shape policy and practice? at the building level practitioners are most familiar with educational research regarding instruction and student achievement primarily from the public sector. for example research on ability grouping has led to efforts to \"detrack\" in some schools research on middle schools has stimulated restmcturing of a number of k-8 schools to include a \"middle school\" at the upper grades research on how the brain leams has promoted the use of new instructional methods. however little research specifically conducted with catholic schools exists on these and similar topics. generalizability to catholic schools is assumed and is probably valid. however replicated research would be desirable.\\nat the diocesan level local research is often used to inform policy and practice. some examples include the demographic research used to help shape decisions about school openings closings and consolidations the evaluations of projects funded by grants and the market research utilized in development and recmitment endeavors.\\nthe opening point of this essay speaks of the unique importance of catholic educators and there is a significant need for more research on their formation. two primary works exist: ncea\\'s research study \"sharing the faith: the beliefs and values of catholic high school teachers\" which is already 12 years old and tan ciriello and convey\\'s study entitled \"commitment and satisfaction among parochial school teachers\" which is more recent.\\nkey among the research needed is study on effective models of initial and on-going fomiation of catholic educators in the ministries of teaching and administration. diocesan offices and individual schools are engaged in a continual quest to find effective ways of forming the cunent and next generation of lay teachers and lay administrators.\\nmany lay personnel had their initial experiences as catholic educators in settings with a large number of priests and religious. now large numbers of people entering catholic education are graduates of non-catholic institutions of higher education and they enter schools which are completely or almost completely staffed by lay people. these circumstances make research on effective methods of formation for ministry a serious need.\\nforming leaders for catholic education at the school and diocesan level is likewise a major challenge. research is needed to clarify the aspects of administration which are unique in a catholic school or a catholic school system. such research is needed for catholic institutions of higher education to respond appropriately to the need to train prospective principals in the theory and skills of educational administration and to assist in forming them as ministers

catholic school administration is different from administration in a public nondenominational or non-catholic religious school. these differences are holistic affecting every action and every decision not just the obvious areas of law or finance. research to clarify the unique role of the catholic education administrator would be a valuable gift to the church to catholic institutions of higher education and to those who will serve in these positions.\\nthere are a number of research projects which would be valuable in addition to the two key items of research described above namely research on effective initial and ongoing formation and research on the unique role of the catholic education administrator. a number of these topics are listed below:\\n• descriptions of catholic school \"systems\" from the perspectives of church structure organizational theory and educational theory • models of effective govemance structures • research on what factors contribute to a positive school climate and how these factors align with the catholic philosophy of education • descriptions of what constitutes catholic identity and how to achieve that identity in an elementary or secondary school • research regarding what is effective in fostering parental valuing of the religious dimension of catholic education • models of christian service programs • models of religious formation of students at various developmental levels • models of addressing students\\' special leaming needs • replication of key research on instruction in the catholic school setting • research designs on topics which can be replicated by dioceses and schools in line with the current emphases on action research and reflective practice.\\ncatholic schools and particularly the educators who teach in them and administer them are indeed a gift to the church both the local church and the universal church. additional and continued valid and reliable research on the unique aspects of the ministry of catholic

northern yucatán peninsula is mainly associated with storm surge events triggered by high-pressure cold front systems. this study evaluates the hydrodynamic processes of the chelem lagoon mexico and the flooding threat from cold fronts for the neighbouring town of progreso. a 30-year water-level hindcast excluding wave set-up was performed because of the lack of long-term tide gauge records. in order to assess the relative contribution from wave set-up and residual and astronomical tides to total flooding the two worst storm scenarios in terms of maximum residual tide event a and maximum water level event b were simulated. numerical results suggest that during event a the wave set-up contribution reaches 0.35 at the coast and 0.17 m inside the lagoon and these values are smaller for event b 0.30 and 0.14 m respectively. results of the effect of the tidal phase on wave set-up and residual sea level show that i the wave set-up contribution increases during ebb tide and decreases during flood tide at the chelem inlet ii the residual tide is larger smaller near low high or receding rising tide and iii maximum flooding occurs when the storm peak coincides with rising or high tide. the numerical results confirm the important role of wave set-up on the assessment of coastal flooding in micro-tidal coastal environments.', '4f4b171e-5d97-49a6-80c0-930057e727e4': 'abstract the

border between alabama and florida? this question is explored using a three-dimensional primitive equation finite volume coastal ocean model. the results show that storm surges are potentially disastrous for the tampa bay area especially for landfalls located to the north of the bay mouth. the worst case among the simulations considered is for landfall at tarpon springs such that the maximum wind is positioned at the bay mouth. along with such regional aspects of storm surge we then consider the dynamical balances to assess the importance of using a three-dimensional model instead of the usual vertically integrated two-dimensional approach to hurricane storm surge simulation. with hurricane storm surge deriving from the vertically integrated pressure gradient force tending to balance the difference between the surface and bottom stresses we show that three-dimensional structure is intrinsically important. two-dimensional models may overestimate or underestimate bottom stress necessitating physically unrealistic parameterizations of surface stress or other techniques for model calibration. our examination of the dynamical balances inherent to storm surges over complex coastal topography suggests that three-dimensional models are preferable over two-dimensional models for simulating storm surges.\\ncitation: weisberg r. h. and l. zheng 2008 hurricane storm

for template-based segmentation and labeling spatial normalization shape analysis and a variety of other tasks has necessitated the construction of gold or \"silver\" standards for validation of different methods and evaluation of their relative merits. although various methods for synthesizing anatomical deformations have occasionally been adopted in the literature they typically rely on analytic forms of deformations such as linear polynomial and spline models or on the displacement of a number of landmarks followed by the thin plate spline tps bookstein 1989 or other interpolations. such approaches generate relatively simple and/or unrealistic deformations and they are unable to capture/simulate the true and full range of anatomical variability. this paper aims to develop approaches that simulate anatomically valid deformations using brain mri as a focus and to generate realistic data sets that could be used for validation of atlas-based segmentation and registration algorithms.\\ntwo classes of deformations and images are simulated. the first class includes deformations between different individuals interindividual deformations and intends to capture inter-individual morphological variability it therefore aims to develop a foundation for generating gold standard for evaluating atlas registration methods. the second class simulates morphological changes that can be encountered within the same individual due to growth or atrophy of brain tissue it therefore aims to develop a foundation for generating gold standard for brain development as well as brain pathology as these are manifested via change of tissue volume.\\nwith respect to the first class the basic premise is that a number of deformation fields are available to be used for estimating the probability density function pdf of high-dimensional deformation fields which can then be randomly sampled to generate any number of synthesized deformations. for the purposes of demonstrating and testing our methodology we used a number of deformations that were obtained using the high-dimensional deformable registration methods described in shen and davatzikos 2002 davatzikos et al. 2003a . this inevitably biases the generated deformations toward the family of deformations that can be generated by this particular warping algorithm and it is somewhat inevitable because there is no truly unbiased way to define deformation fields that are realistic and representative of true anatomical variability. our rationale was that in order to eventually evaluate a number of warping methods each of them could be used for training our simulator and then the rest can be used for testing via comparison against the simulated ground truth. a warping method that consistently performs better in capturing the synthesized known deformations is likely to be more accurate. more accurate training sample deformations could also be generated by first extensively labeling and landmarking a number of images kristi boesen et al. 2005  and then applying a high-dimensional warping algorithm constrained by these manual labels and landmarks. such adequately constrained warping algorithms are likely to generate deformations that are close to a gold standard and therefore appropriate for training.\\nas described above central to the simulator of inter-individual morphological variability is the estimation of the pdf of deformation fields from a limited number of training samples. this is a very challenging task and is the main focus of this paper. one of the most popular methods has been the application of the principal component analysis pca in order to estimate a number of principal components that are frequently called principal modes of variation. however this approach yields poor results when applied to 3d dense deformation fields due to under-training in practical settings. for example accurately estimating a dense 3d deformation field of the entire brain could require tens of thousands of training deformations if not more. the dramatic failure of standard methods for estimating covariance matrices and the associated pdfs has been well known in the signal estimation literature mallat and wavelet 1998 . accordingly in the 1990s methods based on scale-space decompositions were investigated. our approach referred to as statistical simulation of deformations ssd builds upon the methods described in davatzikos et al. 2003ab and xue et al. 2005  which use wavelet-based decompositions in order to more accurately estimate and sample pdfs of high-dimensional deformation fields when only a relatively small number of training samples are available e.g. tens or in the order of 100. random sampling of the pdfs estimated by ssd generates synthesized deformations. moreover a method for constrained sampling is also presented and is applicable when anatomical landmarks from an individual are also available thereby generating deformations that conform to both group-based statistics of morphological variation and limited anatomical information pertaining to the individual. compared to the traditional landmark-based interpolation algorithms the landmark-constrained ssd can generate both richer and anatomically valid deformations.\\nthe second class of deformations simulates intra-individual deformations. unlike inter-individual deformations intra-individual brain deformations reflect the structural changes of an individual brain at different time points e.g. tissue atrophy/growth of a selected structure or within a selected region of a brain. in this paper we use the method proposed in karacali and davatzikos 2006 to simulate the atrophy and growth. that algorithm generates a deformation field by minimizing the difference between its jacobian determinants and the desired ones subject to some smoothness constraints on the deformation field. the desired jacobian determinants describe the volumetric changes of different tissues or different regions.\\nas one of the primary goals of this work is to develop a testbed for validation of deformable registration algorithms various interindividual and intra-individual brain deformations are simulated using the above approaches and a variety of data sets are generated for future use as ground truth in testing template-based segmentation and warping algorithms and to further perform parameter optimization of these algorithms.\\nthe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. the methods section describes the detailed methods used to simulated deformations and the corresponding images and the stimulation results section introduces the simulated data sets and performs evaluations on the simulated data. the summary and conclusion section summarizes and concludes with additional discussions and future directions.', '549cfc1f-824d-4aee-ba80-27ca15e4d33c': 'abstract

that adequately explains the age-associated decrements in muscle mass and strength. the aging process accounts for 30-40% of the declines in strength 3 with the remaining decrease explained by a reduction in habitual activity 45 nutritional deficiencies or chronic disease. physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor that when decreased has been associated with greater muscle strength 6 and reduced mortality rates 7 8 . however the relationship between strength and mortality is less clear than the relationship between physical activity and mortality.\\nthe effects of muscle strength may lie in the higher functional capability associated with greater strength 9 the association with greater lean body mass relative to overall size or the association with higher levels of physical activity and cardiovascular fitness. several studies have shown that stronger individuals have a lower mortality 10-12 and that mortality is more closely related to strength levels than to body mass 12. at present we are unaware of evidence that the effect of strength on mortality is independent of the level of physical activity or muscle mass though rantanen and colleagues 4 have shown that changing strength levels in 75-to 80-year-old subjects are related to their levels of activity. we are also unaware of studies that have examined the impact of nonterminal changes in muscle strength over time on mortality. this study addresses whether muscle strength in men as assessed by grip strength or rate of change in grip strength over time has an independent impact on all-cause mortality

the fuel tanks. the variable conditions under which these propellant tanks operate make analytical models rather difficult to construct. there exists some very good predictive tools for bare tanks of certain geometries but the addition of baffles diaphragms bladders and other slosh control devices invalidates the results obtained by these tools. a strong desire exists to perform large scale monte carlo statistical analyses on spacecraft and launch vehicle dynamic behavior in order to account for these variable conditions. a five or ten thousand case monte carlo study requires a simplified slosh model that can run rapidly in order to compute in a reasonable amount of time. using a primary cfd model to determine parameters for a simplified mechanical analog slosh model holds great promise in terms of increasing accuracy and saving time money and effort on physical ground testing. for this reason this study will focus on a more modern approach that uses computational fluid dynamics techniques to help model the liquid propellant slosh.\\nin three axis stabilized spacecraft coupling between the spacecraft or upper stage flight control system and an unanticipated slosh resonance can result in disaster as seen in the space x falcon 1 mission launched in 2007. unforeseen slosh resonances can result in excessive attitude control fuel usage pointing or attitude control issues that may violate mission requirements. for this reason it is important to fully understand the slosh dynamics of propellants in fuel tanks.\\nin the case of spin stabilized spacecraft any sloshing motion of the fuel will cause a loss of kinetic energy of the spacecraft. since the stabilization of these particular vehicles is dependant on their spin a loss of rotational kinetic energy could prove to be disastrous for the spacecraft and the payload 1 . any transverse rates present during spin stabilization will cause the spacecraft wobble about its spin axis at a certain angle. the angle at which it wobbles or mutates relative to the spin angle is denoted as the nutation angle 2\\'7. for the ideal flight this angle would be relatively small and constant. in actual flight tests small transverse rates cause the propellant sloshing motion to interact with the nutation causing a growth in the nutation angle nutation growth rate. if this nutation angle growth is at too great a rate it may lead to premature depletion of attitude control propellant or even worse as seen in the ats-5 mission launched in 1969 it may lead to a complete loss of control of the vehicle 23\\nusing the main idea behind this continuity equation is to track where the two fluids are. for example if a particular cell has a volume fraction of one it is full of propellant. if a different cell has a volume fraction of zero it contains no propellant and therefore contains air. the interface between these two fluids is tracked by the cells with a volume of fluid value between one and zero. this method is basically a way to track mass of both fluids as it shifts around inside the computational domain. using these equations one can predict the behavior of the sloshing fluid and calculate the forces pressure gradients and velocity field for the entire system as a function of time .\\nthe information acquired from the cfd model will be compared to several test scenarios that have been studied in the laboratory in order to verify the cfd results. once the results have been experimentally verified and there is significant confidence in the values calculated by the cfd technique it will be applied to various scenarios such as variable gravitational conditions larger tanks different shaped tanks and more viscous liquids. ultimately the model will be modified to include tanks with propellant management devices such as diaphragms and baffles. figure 1 illustrates the integration of the cfd model into the current fuel slosh research being conducted at erau. currently the parameter estimation process requires data from experimental results and other simple models. this parameter estimation process will produce values to be used in the initial spacecraft design. the new cfd model will serve as source of data that may be used to verify the experimental results. ultimately the cfd model will be used to obtain \"experimental type\" data for scenarios that are not easily reproduced in the laboratory. fig. 2  the fuel slosh experimental setup at embry riddle aeronautical university consists of three main parts the tank transducer and linear actuator. the tank is an 8\" spherical tank that is suspended by three cables. this allows the tank to freely sway back and forth. a spherical tank was chosen in order to maintain symmetry and simplify the model. the next part of the experimental setup is the force transducer. this force transducer is used to measure the amplitude of the reaction force due to the sloshing fuel. the final component of the experimental setup is the linear actuator. this state-of-the-art linear actuator is used to excite the tank in order to initiate fluid slosh.\\nfor this experimental setup the liquid used in the tank is water. this was chosen because the density and viscosity of water is very similar to that of hydrazine a commonly used propellant. the high level of toxicity and chemical instability of hydrazine makes it a very dangerous substance to work with. the fill level of the fluid inside the tank was 60%. this was used because previous studies have shown that the largest slosh force for a spherical tank will be experienced at this fill level\\nthe effect of energy dissipation in sloshing fuel is best illustrated by exciting the tank with a \"sudden push\" and quickly bringing it to a stop. this causes the fluid to begin sloshing and slowly damp out. the damping effect of the fluid is caused by the fact that the fluid in the tank is not inviscid. the viscous nature of the fluid causes an energy dissipation that will eventually bring the fluid to rest. for water the maximum amplitude of the reaction force decreases over time. this damping is one of the most important effects that the cfd model must replicate in order to validate the fuel slosh behavior because it is through this damping that energy is transferred. another important effect that the cfd model must replicate is the slosh frequency. when the tank is given the initial push the fluid naturally oscillates at a natural frequency. both of these effects must be replicated b y the cfd model. i gurc 2. lperiiiintai st-up figure 3 shows an example of what the experimental data looks like. the force that is being measured by the transducer is the force in the direction of excitation. as expected the force response should be a damped sine wave. this force data is acquired by using a custom designed labview data acquisition system 8 . this data acquisition system is capable of simultaneously monitoring the reading from the force transducer and the position of the linear actuator. the computational domain for the model is comprised of the spherical tank with an opening at the top for filling. the same dimensions were used in the cfd model as in the actual test tank. gridgen was used to create the mesh 9 . this tetrahedral mesh was then imported into ansys fluent and converted into a polyhedral mesh. since ansys fluent uses a finite volume method for solving the flow equations this polyhedral conversion greatly reduces the number of computational cells while still maintaining a high level of accuracy. the polyhedral conversion also helps with convergence of the solution. as seen in fig. 4  the mesh used had most cells clustered near the walls of the tank. this was necessary in order to resolve the viscous effects at the wall that contribute to the damping rate.\\nthe boundary conditions for this model are straight foreword. the walls of the tank are treated as viscous walls with a no slip boundary condition. this may seem counterintuitive in that a no slip condition may keep it from sloshing at all but the fact that the vof equations are actively tracking the interface between the water and air allow the sloshing water to \"climb\" up the walls over time. the boundary condition used at the open top was a pressure inlet. this pressure inlet boundary condition only requires a pressure to be specified and held constant. since in the actual experiment this is exposed to the atmosphere. a pressure of latin. was specified for this boundary.

a health priority internationally. increased consumption of whole-grain foods like cereals and legumes may protect against obesity but concern has been expressed that refined-grain intake may directly

ice-sheet elevations sea-ice thickness and global biomass. however if bathymetry can be reliably retrieved from atlas data this could assist in addressing a key data need in many coastal and inland water body areas including areas that are poorly-mapped and/or difficult to access. additionally atlas-derived bathymetry could be used to constrain bathymetry derived from complementary data such as passive multispectral imagery and synthetic aperture radar sar. as an important first step in evaluating the ability to map bathymetry from atlas this study involves a detailed assessment of bathymetry from the multiple altimeter beam experimental lidar mabel nasa's airborne icesat-2 simulator flown on the earth resources 2 er-2 high-altitude aircraft. an interactive web interface mabel viewer was developed and used to identify bottom returns in keweenaw bay lake superior. after applying corrections for refraction and channel-specific elevation biases mabel bathymetry was compared against national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa data acquired two years earlier.\\nthe results indicate that mabel reliably detected bathymetry in depths of up to 8 m with a root mean square rms difference of 0.7 m with respect to the reference data. additionally a version of the lidar equation was developed for predicting bottom-return signal levels in mabel and tested using the

presented in this paper points in a different direction: the wedge in returns is explained by the existence of academic two-year colleges in fact it is actually more general because vocational schools explain the wedge in returns for students who enroll in academic two-year colleges as high school graduates sort across the different enrollment alternatives. in particular high school graduates who enroll in fouryear colleges have measures of observables that lie above those who enroll in academic two-year colleges. it follows that the high school graduate with the lowest measures of observables who enrolls in a four-year college is indifferent to enrollment at academic two-year colleges as opposed to being indifferent to joining the labor force. using the parameterized version of the model

system dynamics and performance. as an example a hazardous overturns of a large liquid cargo from the forces induced by the slosh [1] . therefore slosh control is important in suppressing the residual slosh induced by the container motion [2] .\\nliquid slosh control system is a class of the underactuated mechanical systems. this class of system is well known for the very challenging problem of the controller design due to the small number of input space dimension compared to its controlled variable. in recent decades various control strategies for slosh control systems have been widely reported [1]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]  [7]  [8] . the common ground shared in these reported works are hard to apply in practice due to their control designs derived based on the model of the systems. this is because of the control designs normally impose a huge gap between control theory and real applications due to the unmodeled dynamics problem. in order to vanish this gap control researchers are now diverting to model-free control approach since its controller design is based on only the input and output data measurement of actual process plants. in other words this scheme does not explicitly include any parts or the whole of plant models which make its control performance independence of the plant model accuracy. particularly a model-free proportional-integralderivative pid tuning is one of the promising model-free control strategies due to its simplicity understandable and more reliable to the industrial usage.\\nit is crucial to design a pid tuning scheme that perform lesser computation time. for example the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation spsa approach has been widely implemented in the data-driven controller tuning due to its effectiveness in using only two objective functions to update the controller parameters [2]  [9]  [10] . nevertheless there is a probability that the of design parameters in spsa changed to huge values and abruptly trapped in an unpractical region. in order to solve this weakness the modified spsa algorithm is introduced in [11]  where the saturation function is used to avoid the unstable solution during the optimization [2] . however with the introduction of this saturation function there are additional parameters to be determine in advanced which may require a lot of effort. moreover the saturation function will also limit the searching capability of the algorithm. in order to overcome these problems the safe experimentation dynamics sed [12]  [13] based method is seen a promising tool for this view point. it is because the sed algorithm produces stable convergence less parameters to be used and robust to any disturbance and uncertain dynamics changes during tuning process. hitherto there are few works to discuss the application of the sed to model-free pid tuning problems. therefore it would be useful to investigate the proposed method competency in tuning the slosh control system. this research thus implements the sed algorithm in a datadriven pid tuning for slosh control system. the proposed controller effectiveness will be evaluated by numerical examples. hence the efficiency of the tuning scheme will be evaluated based on the tracking performance control input energy and computation time. furthermore a comparative assessment between the sed based method and spsa based method are discussed.\\nthe reminder of this paper is structured as follows the datadriven pid controller problem formulation for slosh control tuning is expressed in section ii. while in section iii

experiences will relate to subsequent transitions to adulthood. belonging to a positive peer group likely leads to a positive effect on adolescents\\' schooling outcomes. at the same time being exposed to an older and therefore more sexually active peer group might encourage adolescents to become sexually active.\\nbecause most adolescents in urban south africa become sexually active before they leave school the \"protective effect\" of schools may not extend to protection from risky sex. one of the intriguing results found in previous analyses of sexual debut in urban south africa using the same data as in this study was a positive effect of baseline grade attainment on sexual debut in the subsequent four years controlling for baseline age dinkelman lam and leibbrandt 2007 and marteleto lam and ranchhod 2008 . estimating probit regressions of a number of individual and household characteristics on sexual debut marteleto and colleagues 2008 found that the number of grades completed by 2002 had a significant positive effect on sexual debut between 2002 and 2005 for both boys/young men and girls/young women who were aged 14-16 in 2002 . these positive effects of schooling on sexual debut controlling for age are surprising because we might expect that young people who are ahead of their age group in school would be less likely to become sexually active. the estimates imply that a girl aged 14-16 who had completed one extra grade in 2002 given her age was 6.6 percentage points more likely to sexually debut by 2005. the effect for young men was slightly greater at 8 percentage points.\\none possible interpretation of this result is that young people who are ahead of many in their cohort in school interact with an older and more sexually active group of young men and women. because of the high rates of grade repetition in south africa students in any given grade in secondary school span a wide range of ages especially in predominantly african schools. adolescents could be influenced by the behavior of older same-sex peers and by interactions with older opposite-sex peers. we hypothesize that the effects on sexual initiation of grades completed is a consequence of two offsetting mechanisms. the first is that students who do better in school may be less likely to become sexually active. the second is that the influence of older peers is toward encouraging sexual debut. we attempt to disentangle these two effects in our models by using a literacy and numeracy proficiency measure in addition to a constructed measure of exposure to older peers.\\nthis study explores these possible peer effects in greater detail in the south african context. our analysis is similar in nature to recent research in the united states that tries to identify \"contagion\" effects of interacting with older peers. a recent article by argys and rees 2008  for example uses variation in the mandated age at which children begin school across the united states as an exogenous source of variation in exposure to older classmates during the teenage years. another study used the variation in whether ninth graders are grouped with tenth-to twelfth-grade students or with seventh-to eighth-grade students eisenberg 2004 .\\na significant body of research has been conducted in the us on the effects of peers on the behavior and life decisions of students at various levels. exploiting the random assignment of college roommates sacerdote 2001 found evidence of peer effects among roommates on academic outcomes and decisions to join social groups. analyzing tenth-grade classmates in the national education longitudinal study nels of 1988 gaviria and raphael 2001 found evidence of peer effects at the school level on substance use church attendance and dropping out of high school. using us data from the national longitudinal survey of adolescent june 2013 studies in family planning 44 2 health sieving and colleagues 2006 found that a significant positive relationship existed between the proportion of a young person\\'s friends who were sexually active in wave 1 and the probability of sexual debut between waves 1 and 2. our analysis takes advantage of the high variance in age-for-grade distributions in cape town especially in predominantly nonwhite schools. an important feature of cape town is the continuing large socioeconomic disparities and the high degree of spatial segregation across the three major racial groups referred to as \"population groups\" in south africa: african colored and white. the cape town

access to services and the most restrictions on work and migration with a large gap in expenditures on schooling. the colored population which is heavily concentrated in the western cape including cape town occupied an intermediate status under apartheid with greater expenditures on schooling fewer restrictions on residential mobility and better access to jobs than africans.\\n1 using

various brain imaging studies from tracking the maturation of adolescent brains to mapping gray matter atrophy patterns in alzheimer's disease. popular surface mapping approaches based on spherical registration however have inherent numerical limitations when severe metric distortions are present during the spherical parameterization step. in this paper we propose a novel computational framework for intrinsic surface mapping in the laplace-beltrami lb embedding space based on riemannian metric optimization on surfaces rmos. given a diffeomorphism between two surfaces an isometry can be defined using the pullback metric which in turn results in identical lb embeddings from the two surfaces. the proposed rmos approach builds upon this mathematical foundation and achieves general feature-driven surface mapping in the lb embedding space by iteratively optimizing the riemannian metric defined on the edges of triangular meshes. at the core of our framework is an optimization

association between dense parental networks and student achievement can be attributed almost entirely to these basic conditioning variables. these results represent at best a mixed verdict for

fluctuating environmental temperatures animals have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense and adapt to temperature changes. animals sense temperature through various molecular thermosensors such as thermosensitive transient receptor potential trp channels expressed in neurons keratinocytes and intestine. these evolutionarily conserved thermosensitive trp channels feature distinct activation thresholds thereby covering a wide spectrum of ambient temperature. temperature changes trigger complex thermosensory behaviors. due to the simplicity of the nervous system in model organisms such as caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila the mechanisms of thermosensory behaviors in these species have been extensively studied at the circuit and molecular levels. while much is known about temperature regulation of behavior it remains largely unclear how temperature affects aging. recent studies in c. elegans demonstrate that temperature modulation of longevity is not simply a passive thermodynamic phenomenon as suggested by the rateof-living theory but rather a process that is actively regulated by genes including those encoding thermosensitive trp channels. in this review we discuss our current understanding of thermosensation and its role in aging.', '71937ff2-9503-4b3c-ac5a-36482b394c6b': 'abstract prior research on oppositional culture theory has generally focused on beliefs about the opportunity structure or the \"acting white\" hypothesis as an explanation for racial differences in school achievement. however little attention has been given to the mechanism by which these beliefs affect achievement: schooling behaviors. the authors posit that students\\' prior level of skills may be an important omitted factor that biases the effect of schooling behaviors on achievement. using data from the national educational longitudinal survey they found that whereas behaviors account for a larger proportion of asian americans\\' achievement advantage than do prior skills prior skills explain half to nearly three-quarters of blacks\\' low achievement relative to that of whites and that dramatic declines in behavioral effects on achievement are observed after prior skills are controlled. finally the findings show that schooling behaviors are partially shaped by prior skills. they suggest that students with low skill levels prior to high school are likely to have poor achievement at the end of their high school careers regardless of their schooling behaviors during high school. e xplaining racial differences in achievement continues to remain important to researchers educators and policy makers. one explanation for variation in achievement among minority groups during adolescence that has garnered much attention is ogbu\\'s 1978 oppositional culture theory or resistance model. the theory posits that racial differences in school achievement occur because asian americans adopt pro-schooling behaviors and blacks adopt an oppositional culture that is characterized by counterproductive schooling behaviors e.g. being disruptive in class not doing homework relative to whites fordham and ogbu 1986 . thus most studies on oppositional culture theory have focused on causes of racial differences in schooling behaviors-differences in perceptions about the opportunity structure. the behavioral response to these beliefs that has received the most attention is the \"acting white\" hypothesis which proposes that good school performance is denigrated and labeled as acting white see e.g. carter 1999 carter  2005 cook and ludwig 1997 downey and

irregular times for a sample of subjects. in longitudinal studies the number of repeated measurements per subject is often small and may be modeled as a discrete random number and accordingly only a finite and asymptotically nonincreasing number of measurements are available for each subject or experimental unit. we propose a functional regression approach for this situation using functional principal component analysis where we estimate the functional principal component scores through conditional expectations. this allows the prediction of an unobserved response trajectory from sparse measurements of a predictor trajectory. the resulting technique is flexible and allows for different patterns regarding the timing of the measurements obtained for predictor and response trajectories. asymptotic properties for a sample of n subjects are investigated under mild conditions as n → ∞ and we obtain consistent estimation for the regression function. besides convergence results for the components of functional linear regression such as the regression parameter function we construct asymptotic pointwise confidence bands for the predicted trajectories. a functional coefficient of

emotionality and positive emotionality. a. r. harkness et al. 1995 noted a number of similarities and differences between the psy-5 constructs and those represented in the ffm. as for similarities both the psy-5 and measures of the ffm e.g. the revised neo personality inventory costa & mccrae 1992b  include scales to measure dispositions toward the experience of negative affectivity/emotionality as well as positive emotionality and social engagement. thus the psy-5 constructs of negative emotionality and positive emotionality are similar to their ffm counterparts of neuroticism and extraversion. however a. r. harkness et al. 1995 argued that psy-5 aggressiveness constraint and psychoticism constructs do not have direct ffm counterparts. first psy-5 aggressiveness was said to tap more extreme traits related to low agreeableness but low psy-5 aggressiveness is not indicative of high agreeableness. second low levels of psy-5 constraint impulsiveness and risk-taking do not correspond to low conscientiousness disorganization and carelessness. and finally psy-5 psychoticism has no ffm counterpart according to harkness et al. these propositions have not been subjected to direct empirical test.\\na. r. harkness et al. 1995 argued that the psy-5 scales should be more relevant to personality disorder pathology than are ffm scales such as the neo personality inventory neo-pi. as a. r. harkness and mcnulty 1994 noted the ffm originated in analyses of lay trait terms taken from the dictionary whereas the psy-5 constructs were derived from an analysis of personality disorder symptoms. further the psy-5 scales were created from the items of the mmpi-2 butcher dahl-strom graham tellegen & kaemmer 1989  which was designed as a measure of psychopathology. given these differences it would not be surprising if the psy-5 scales were better predictors of personality pathology. however no direct comparison between the usefulness of the psy-5 and neo-pi in the assessment of personality disorders has been conducted.\\nin this article we present results from two studies that examined the relationship between the mmpi-2 psy-5 scales and

practice in the field of social sciences. as used in the social sciences mixed effects regression models take into account that observations on individual respondents are nested within higherlevel groups such as schools classrooms states and countries snijders and bosker 1999  and are often referred to as multilevel regression models. despite these models' increasing popularity diagnostic tools to evaluate fitted models lag behind.\\nwe introduce influence.me nieuwenhuis pelzer and te grotenhuis 2012 an r-package that provides tools for detecting influential cases in mixed effects regression models estimated with lme4 bates and maechler 2010 . it is commonly accepted that tests for influential data should be performed on regression models especially when estimates are based on a relatively small number of cases. however most existing procedures do not account for the nesting structure of the data. as a result these existing procedures fail to detect that higher-level cases may be influential on estimates of variables measured at specifically that level.\\nin this paper we outline the basic rationale on detecting influential data describe standardized measures of influence provide a practical example of the analysis of students in 23 schools and discuss strategies for dealing with influential cases. testing for influential cases in mixed effects regression models is important because influential data negatively influence the statistical fit and generalizability of the model. in social science applications of mixed models the testing for influential data is especially important since these models are frequently based on large numbers of observations at the individual level while the number of higher level groups is relatively small. for instance van der meer te grotenhuis and pelzer 2010 were unable to find any country-level comparative studies involving more than 54 countries. with such a relatively low number of countries a single country can easily be overly influential on the parameter estimates of one or more of the country-level variables.\\nall cases used to estimate a regression model exert some level of influence on the regression parameters. however if a single case has extremely high or low scores on the dependent variable relative to its expected value -given other variables in the model one or more of the independent variables or both -this case may overly influence the regression parameters by 'pulling' the estimated regression line towards itself. the simple inclusion or exclusion of such a single case may then lead to substantially different regression estimates. this runs against distributional assumptions associated with regression models and as a result limits the validity and generalizability of regression models in which influential cases are present.\\nthe analysis of residuals cannot be used for the detection of influential cases crawley 2007 . cases with high residuals defined as the difference between the observed and the predicted scores on the dependent variable or with high standardized residuals defined as the residual divided by the standard deviation of the residuals are indicated as outliers. however an influential case is not always an outlier. on the contrary: a strongly influential case dominates the regression model in such a way that the estimated regression line lies closely to this case. although influential cases thus have extreme values on one or more of the variables they can be onliers rather than outliers. to account for this the standardized deleted residual is defined as the difference between the observed score of a case on the dependent variable and the predicted score from the regression model that is based on data from which that case was removed.\\njust as influential cases are not necessarily outliers outliers are not necessarily influential cases. this also holds for deleted residuals. the reason for this is that the amount of influence a case exerts on the regression slope is not only determined by how well its observed score is fitted by the specified regression model but also by its scores on the the\",

younger 5 but are better able to survive in a frail state for a long time 6-8. these findings have been corroborated across diverse populations from all around the world including chinese mexicans europeans north americans and australians 7. even when taking frailty criteria one at a time women show higher incidence than men for all but one 9.\\nthis leads to the characterization of male aging as more \"catastrophic\" than female aging in the sense that men tend to experience more rapid declines than women. this male-female health-survival paradox mfhsp has been broadly replicated 7 even at age 85 and over 10. moreover the mfhsp was found in a mormon population 11 a population in which women have higher fertility rates and thus a higher mortality risk and men have fewer unhealthy behaviors supporting the existence of underlying biological mechanisms rather than solely lifestyle or behavioral causes. yet this mechanistic understanding is still lacking 12.\\nmore generally

episodically and under energetic conditions that make quantitative observations difficult. we measured water levels on both sides of a barrier island in the northern chandeleur islands during inundation by hurricane isaac. wind patterns caused the water levels to slope from the bay side to the ocean side for much of the storm. modeled geomorphic changes during the storm were very sensitive to the cross-island slopes imposed by water-level boundary conditions. simulations with equal or landward sloping water levels produced the characteristic barrier island storm response of overwash deposits or displaced berms with smoother final topography. simulations using the observed seaward sloping water levels produced cross-barrier channels and deposits of sand on the ocean side consistent with poststorm observations. this sensitivity indicates that accurate water-level boundary conditions must be applied on both sides of a barrier to correctly represent the geomorphic response to inundation events. more broadly the consequence of seaward transport is that it alters the relationship between storm intensity and volume of landward transport. sand transported to the ocean side may move downdrift or aid poststorm recovery by moving onto the beach face or closing recent breaches but it does not contribute to island transgression or appear as an overwash deposit in the back-barrier stratigraphic record. the high vulnerability of the chandeleur islands allowed us to observe processes that are infrequent but may be important at other barrier islands.',

classifiers. further the scb variable importances are enhanced by means of transductive conformal analysis. this extra step is important when the data can be assumed to be heterogeneous. finally the proposal of these scb variable importance measures is completed with the derivation of a parametric hypothesis test of variable importance. the new importance measures were compared with a t-test

callosum which may be biased by local variability in callosal shape. this issue is particularly critical as sex differences in the shape of the corpus callosum have been reported allen et al. 1991 .\\nin this paper we apply a new methodology davatzikos et al. 1996 for corpus callosum measurement on mr images which allows measurement of size differences while accounting for local variability in shape. we test three hypotheses: i there are sex differences in corpus callosum morphology particularly in splenial size based on delacoste-utamsing and holloway's autopsy data delacoste-utamsing and holloway 1982 ii age is negatively correlated with corpus callosum size in both men and women iii corpus callosum size is associated with better performance on cognitive tests for women but not men. as it has been argued that women have greater bilateral representation of function larger callosal size would facilitate interhemispheric transfer and cognitive performance in women but would not inf luence performance in men who demonstrate greater hemispheric specialization for a variety of functions. our results strongly support the hypotheses that there are sex and age differences in corpus callosum morphology and that callosal size is associated with better cognitive performance in women but not men.\\nmaterials and methods\\nsubjects are non-demented participants in the baltimore

whether in fact african american and latino students remain behind their white peers in the level of math reached by the end of high school even when they start at the same place this article offers new empirical evidence about the process through which inequality emerges.\\nadditionally while previous research has brought attention to the underrepresentation of african american and latino students in advanced level math courses there has been much less attention to the intersection between gender and race-ethnicity hanson 1996 muller et al. 2001 tate 1997 . recently the gender gap in advanced level math course taking has closed such that females are now as likely to take advanced classes such as precalculus and calculus as their male peers bae et al. 2000 freeman 2004 xie and shauman 2003 . while this indicates clear progress for young women generally understanding how such patterns relate to the educational attainment of african american and latina girls is complex as minority females may outperform their male peers at the same time that they remain behind white students of their own gender. thus the intersection between gender and raceethnicity with regard to course taking warrants further attention and is a main focus of this article.\\nfinally this article examines the role of academic performance in shaping the progress of students of different genders and racial-ethnic groups through the sequence of high school math courses. course failure is a major obstacle to students\\' attainment of advanced level math courses regardless of their initial math course and therefore could help to explain why minority students might not receive the same return from their math courses early in high school. yet it is also possible that the link between performance and advanced level math course taking is not the same for students of different genders and racialethnic groups. examining how grades shape the process of students\\' math course taking from the beginning to the end of high school is an important part of understanding racial-ethnic and gender inequality in math attainment.\\nto assess disparities in math course-taking patterns across high school and the role of academic performance the analyses utilize a new nationally representative educational data set the adolescent health and academic achievement ahaa. the ahaa is a recently completed high school transcript study and a component of the national longitudinal study of adolescent catherine riegle-crumb is a postdoctoral research associate at the university of texas at austin. her research focuses primarily on gender inequality and educational stratification. she is also currently working on examining the educational intersection between gender and race-ethnicity as well as the links between education and health behaviors among adolescents.\\nhealth add health and it provides the chance to examine inequality in high schools during the 1990s. specifically i address two main issues. first i examine whether african american and latino students both male and female ultimately reach comparable level math courses as their white peers when they begin in the same course position. second i examine the role that academic performance plays in the process of students\\' math course taking to discern whether students from different genders and racial-ethnic groups might not reach comparable levels of math despite starting in the same position because of receiving lower grades or whether in fact the consequences of grades themselves vary by race-ethnicity and gender.\\nthe path through math: course sequences high school course taking in math is typically organized in a hierarchical sequence of courses where individual courses that are part of a larger unified subject are taught with progressive levels of difficulty throughout each year of high school adelman 1999 schneider et al. 1998 stevenson et al. 1994 . previous research has documented a hierarchical math sequence categorized at the lower end by general math and beginning algebra classes and at the high end by advanced courses such as trigonometry and calculus adelman 1999 schiller and hunt 2003 schneider et al. 1998 . skills and concepts build on one another throughout the sequence meaning that curricula in one class must generally be mastered before students can successfully move to the next course in the sequence.\\nthe hierarchical nature of math course taking and its accompanying structure of prerequisites create a positional advantage for those students who begin high school taking courses that are higher in the sequence schneider et al. 1998 . in contrast to other subjects such as english math offers a much less \"open\" path so that where students begin the math sequence is strongly connected to how far they can reach by the end of high school lucas 1999 . 1 specifically if students do not begin high school taking algebra i or geometry they have little chance of reaching advanced courses such as trigonometry and calculus-and it is these courses that most strongly predict college attendance both overall and at elite postsecondary institutions adelman 1999 adelman  2003 schneider 2003 .\\nyet while starting at a higher position in the math sequence is a necessary step for reaching advanced courses by the end it is not sufficient. throughout the intervening high school years certain students may be at a higher risk of losing this initial course advantage than others. research focusing on broadly defined academic tracks has addressed whether the course trajectories of minority groups follow patterns similar to those of other students see e.g. american journal of education hallinan 1996 lucas 1999 lucas and berends 2002 oakes 1990 .\\n2 in general this research offers evidence that african american and latino students may be more likely to \"fall out\" of an initial position of advantage compared with their white peers.\\nin regard to the highly sequenced math courses that students take throughout high school the issue of potentially different returns from initial math course position has clear implications for understanding educational inequality in high school and for designing policies to reduce it. for example if in fact african american and latino students receive the same returns from early course taking-such that when they begin high school in the same level of the math sequence they subsequently reach the same level by the end of high school-then the biggest hurdle to racial-ethnic inequality is the initial course position and the processes that led up to it. however if these minority students do not receive the same return from beginning in a relatively high course position then we need to focus on understanding the factors that operate throughout the years of high school that push them out of this initial position of advantage. this detailed focus on students\\' movement through math course sequences will enable more definitive conclusions to be drawn and policies designed to promote equitable outcomes among students of different races and ethnicities.',

states about the underrepresentation of women in science technology engineering and mathematics stem. the commonly used metaphor of a stem pipeline typically suggests that females are more likely than males to exit or leak from the pipeline at every key juncture including being more likely to leave a stem major while in college clark-blickenstaff 2005 . for example griffith 2010 argues that persistence in stem is \"much lower\" for women and suggests that \"this may be a leaky joint in the stem pipeline\" p. 911. however empirical evidence about whether or not women leave stem majors at higher rates than men is limited particularly among recent cohorts of college matriculates. in this study the most recent nationally representative data set designed to follow students through the college years is used to thoroughly examine the gender gap in stem persistence.\\nwithin the literature on gender inequality in stem fields there are conflicting results about gender differences in college stem persistence. some prior literature finds that women in stem have lower college persistence rates than male stem students. for example in their well-known study of stem attrition seymour and hewitt 1997 found evidence that among their analytic sample of students with high sat scores from seven universities women were more likely than men to leave stem majors. in an investigation at a single elite research university ost 2010 found a similar pattern but concluded that the gender gap was driven almost entirely by differences in the physical sciences. several additional studies that involve samples with high-achieving students have found that women are less likely than men to persist in stem majors strenta elliott adair matier & scott 1994 ware & dill 1986 . the generalizability of these patterns to a national scale is unclear due to their selective samples of either individuals or institutions.\\nstudies using national data have produced conflicting results. using data from the 1982 cohort of high school and beyond xie and shauman 2003 found no gender gap when measuring persistence to a stem degree from the end of students\\' sophomore year. however using data from the national longitudinal study of freshman and the national education longitudinal study of 1988 nels:88 griffith 2010 found that female stem majors were less likely to persist than male stem majors. additionally chen 2013 examines stem attrition and finds that women are more likely than men to switch out of stem majors. yet as with xie and shauman these later studies consider all stem fields in the aggregate therefore potentially masking differences that exist between the life sciences and computer science engineering mathematics and physical science cemp. in sum the conflicting results obtained in past studies demonstrate the need for a more detailed analysis of current patterns.\\ndepartures from stem are common some studies estimate 45% to 50% of students who enter stem never earn a stem degree chen 2009 daempfle 2002 . however it is not clear whether males and females leave these majors at similar rates. chen\\'s 2009 bps found that 47% of stem students either withdrew from school or switched to a non-stem major and he indicated that \"no gender difference was evident\" p. 14.\\nperhaps some of the factors contributing to the low persistence rate observed in stem affect males\\' and females\\' decisions about persistence similarly. past research suggests that a unique culture exists in many introductory-level mathematics and science courses sometimes referred to as weedout or gatekeeper courses barnes 1997 cairney hodgdon & o 2008 gasiewski eagan garcia hurtado & chang 2012 . these courses are known for having large numbers of students lecture-based teaching a competitive environment and for assigning low grades achen & courant 2009 brainard & carlin 1998 seymour & hewitt 1997 . furthermore the dominant philosophy of grading used in these courses is one in which students are ranked against one another according to the normal curve thus ensuring that not all students are successful kulick & wright 2008 tobias 1990 . many scholars have critiqued this approach to learning in stem arguing it leads to high rates of departure among both male and female students daempfle 2002 gasiewski et al. 2012 seymour & hewitt 1997 .\\nothers have argued that the environment in the college classroom is not the same for men and women. sandler and hall 1982 coined the term \"chilly climate\" to describe the differential treatment of women in the classroom. this treatment can range from more overt behavior such as encouraging women to switch majors or discrediting women\\'s intellectual abilities to less overt behaviors such as interrupting women when they speak or calling on males more often sandler & hall 1982 . despite decreases in overt sexism over the past few decades women continue to be subject to subtler forms of gender biases moss-racusin dovidio brescoll graham & handelsman 2012 spence & hahn 1997 .\\nmany studies have examined whether the chilly climate affects women\\'s decisions to switch out of stem majors. morris and daniel 2008 found that women were more likely to find the climate chillier than men but this was not related to their intention to leave the field. similarly seymour and hewitt 1997 found the women in their study were subject to subtle behaviors indicating they were not welcome in the major but they concluded \"this kind of behavior appeared to make women more determined not to be driven away\" p. 247. women who enter stem fields have already gone against typical gender norms and may not be influenced by differential treatment once in a stem major rieglecrumb king & moore 2016. furthermore stem fields are highly valued and often lead to high-paying high-status jobs clark-blickenstaff 2005 staniec & ordovensky 2004 . so whether or not stem fields are chilly women may have added incentives to remain in the field.\\nin some cases the gender bias may not be visible but nonetheless might be a contributing factor in decisions to leave the field. moss-racusin et al. 2012 conducted a study in which science faculty were asked to rate male and female students\\' applications for employment as a lab manager. despite the fact that the male and female applications were identical male students were rated more favorably and males were given higher starting salaries and more career mentoring. this form of hidden bias places female students at a disadvantage in stem majors and therefore may lead to lower persistence rates.\\ndata from the most recent nationally representative study designed to follow students throughout the college years the bps:04/09 are used to investigate gender differences in the within-field persistence rates of students who initially major in stem. the study addresses the limitations of previous research in several ways. first subfields within the broad category of stem are considered. several past studies have emphasized the need to look at subfields of stem separately when examining gender differences chen 2013 ost 2010 tai lui maltese & fan 2006. given that enrollment patterns by gender in life science majors are equitable whereas males continue to be overrepresented in cemp national science board 2008 it is important to examine these fields separately.\\nadditionally to ensure that the results hold with different analytic sample specifications analyses including and excluding non-degree earners are examined. past research has documented that men are more likely to leave college without earning a degree than their female counterparts buchmann & diprete 2006 . aud et al. 2013 found that among first-time full-time undergraduates who began their studies at a 4-year degree-granting institution 56% of men and 61% of females earned a college degree within 6 years. since males are more likely to leave college without a degree it is necessary to also consider patterns among only those students who earn a degree. the decision to limit the sample to degree earners is common in previous studies seymour & hewitt 1997 sonnert fox & adkins 2007 perhaps because the reasons for leaving college and switching majors are not the same buchman & diprete 2006. finally as men and women who select stem majors may differ from one another in a variety of ways the study considers whether patterns of persistence are robust to the inclusion of individual and institutional characteristics.\\nthe bps:04/09 was designed by the national center of education statistics for the u.s. department of education. bps is the most recent data set including information on a nationally representative sample of students focused on the college years. it was designed with the specific intention of informing educational policies related to college persistence bps used a two-stage design whereby institutions were selected in the first stage and eligible students within these institutions were selected in the second stage. student interviews were conducted via the web telephone or in the field and students were offered a small monetary incentive to participate. eighty-two percent of the eligible sample participated in the study wine janson & wheeless 2011 .\\nrespondents were interviewed at the end of their first academic year 20032004 with follow-up surveys conducted in 2006 and 2009. between the waves of data collection a proportion of the original sample was excluded from additional data collection. this was frequently due to survey nonresponse or evidence that the student did not attend a postsecondary school in [2003][2004]. in addition to the student interviews postsecondary transcripts were collected. at least one transcript was received for 92% of the sample. the transcripts provided information about students\\' degrees and majors courses dates of college attendance and standardized test scores. last information about each institution submitting transcripts was collected such as enrollment size and selectivity of the school.\\ndue to the two-stage sampling design the unequal probability of attrition from the sample and missing or incomplete transcript data all analyses were completed using the wtb000 weight. this weight was created by bps staff and it is recommended for use in analyses involving both survey and transcript data jagešić 2015 wine et al. 2011 . using the weight helps ensure that the sample of students selected for this study from the npsas:04 are indeed representative of all students in the npsas:04. for more information on the weighting procedure used in bps see chapter 6 of wine et al. 2011 . all missing data from the student interviews were imputed by bps staff using weighted hot-deck imputation wine et al. 2011 . in the hot-deck procedure a relatively homogenous group of observations is identified and a single observation is selected at random and used to impute the missing data point. the small amount of missing data found on some of the transcript variables used in this study was imputed using the imputation command in stata college stem grade point average gpa 3% highest math course taken 4% high school gpa 9% and sat scores 10%.\\nthe analytic sample for this study included 1694 students who attended a 4-year institution and reported during the 2003-2004 interview that their initial college major was in a stem field. in this article two subfields of stem were considered cemp which included 65.1% of the sample and the life sciences. cemp includes students from computer and information sciences 22.3% engineering and engineering technologies/technicians 34.8% mathematics and statistics 3.8% and physical science 4.7%.\\nthe life sciences include students from biological and biomedical sciences 30.4% agriculture and related sciences 2.1% and natural resources and conservations 2.2%. ideally each major within cemp and the life sciences would be investigated individually however due to the small number of male and/or female students found within many of these majors and even smaller numbers who persist such analyses would be unreliable. among the sample of students who intended to major in stem males 63.6% outnumbered females 34.4%. this discrepancy is even more substantial when considering that 56% of the students from bps who attended a 4-year institution were female berkner & choy 2008 . within stem subfields the gender gap varies significantly. female stem majors are more likely to enter the life sciences whereas male stem students are more likely to enter cemp. as a result women accounted for 61.5% of the students intending to major in the life sciences but only 20.0% of those who intended to major in cemp.\\nthe outcome variable in this study measures whether or not a student persists within his or her initial field of study and earns a bachelor\\'s degree. this variable was constructed using the response to a survey question in the first wave of data collected during students\\' freshman year asking them to state their intended major. to persist students must earn a degree within 6 years of beginning school in the same stem subfield as their intended major. for example if a student\\'s intended major is mathematics to be considered as persisting he or she must earn a degree within 6 years in a major within cemp. two ways of measuring nonpersistence are considered. in the first all stem students who either do not earn a degree or earn a degree outside of their original subfield are included as nonpersisters. in the second students who do not earn a degree are removed from the analytic sample resulting in a comparison between students who persist and students who switch fields and earn a degree in another area.\\nlooking at persistence among all students who intended to major in stem 34.8% of males and 37.7% of females earn a stem degree within 6 years of beginning school. a t test revealed that this small difference was not significant indicating that male and female stem students persist at statistically equivalent rates m men = 0.348 sd men = 0.468 m women = 0.377 sd women = 0.501 t767 = −0.89 p = .373.\\nto further examine whether a gender gap in persistence exists the broad category of stem was broken down to examine persistence rates separately for students in cemp and the life sciences. looking at the persistence rates within each stem subfield see the first portion of figure 1  it is clear that women do not have lower persistence rates in either cemp or the life sciences. in cemp 31.4% of males compared to 36.3% of females persist. in the life sciences 31.5% of males and 32.6% of female persist. male college students are more likely to leave school without a degree than female college students buchmann & diprete 2006 . berkner and choy 2008 found that among students in bps who started at a 4-year institution 22% of males compared to 17.1% of females had left school without a degree before june 2006. therefore to ensure that these results are not sensitive to the specification of the analytic sample the analyses are repeated excluding students who leave school without earning a degree. the latter portion of figure 1 displays the persistence rates by gender when students who leave college without a degree are removed from the sample. again it is clear that men and women in cemp and the life sciences persist at similar rates. in cemp both men and women persist 65.1% of the time whereas women\\'s persistence rates are slightly higher 57.0% compared to 53.6% in the life sciences.\\nin exploratory analyses the dependent variable was constructed so that students who persisted must earn a degree in the same area as their intended major. for example a student who majors in computer science is considered as persisting only if his or her degree was awarded in computer science. defining persistence in this way resulted in substantively similar results. most notably there were no significant gender differences in persistence.\\nbackground preparation and college characteristics', '8b9f3d43-488f-42f0-92af-2d2498f58d0c': 'abstract a number of biological

that can influence these relationships e.g. measurements study design and obesity. the primary purpose of this review was to synthesize the current evidence on the association between serum 25ohd and cognition giving special consideration to specific influential factors. a search was conducted in pubmed for studies published between 2010 and 2018 using terms related to serum 25ohd and cognition. only studies that used liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry lc-ms were included since this is considered the 'gold standard method' to measure serum 25ohd. of the 70 articles evaluated 13

two randomized controlled trials showed inconsistent results on the impact of vitamin d supplementation on cognitive function. the varied methodologies for ascertaining cognition and the inclusion or exclusion of confounding variables e.g. obesity sunlight exposure in the statistical analyses make drawing conclusions on the association between serum 25ohd and cognitive functioning inherently difficult. despite the known higher occurrence of serum 25oh deficiency among minority populations the majority of studies were conducted in with white participants. in order to more clearly discern the relationship between serum 25ohd and cognitive functioning future studies should target more diverse study populations and utilize comprehensive measures to reliably capture cognition as well as

running through such approaches: the idea that an observational study can be considered as a randomized experiment conditional on certain covariates. the approaches differ in the statistical assumptions they make and the methods they apply to the data. in this article the focus is on a method of controlling for bias known as the heckman model greene 1993 heckman 1978 heckman  1979 heckman & robb 1986 .\\n1 although the heckman model is a well-established approach among econometricians its use is less common among educational statisticians. much of what follows serves as a didactic introduction to the heckman model for the benefit of this latter audience but more generally this article presents the assumptions that would be necessary before the heckman model could be used to draw causal inferences in an observational setting.\\nto give this presentation an applied context i use the heckman model to evaluate the effectiveness of coaching programs in improving performance on the sat. the sat is required for admission at almost all competitive 4-year colleges in the united states and has a math and verbal section each scored on a scale that ranges from 200 to 800 with a standard deviation of about 110 points.\\n2 each year about 2 million high school students take the test at a cost of about $25 each. coaching for the sat and many other standardized tests is a multimillion dollar industry. such companies as kaplan and the princeton review charge roughly $800 for 30-40 hours of instruction and have attributed to their programs average gains of 100-140 points on the combined math and verbal sections of the test schwartz 1999 . private tutors books videos and computer software are also available at a price to help students prepare for the test. it has become widely accepted among the general public that coaching has a large effect on student scores. however most published research on the topic suggests that the combined coaching effect is fairly small in the range of about 20-30 points becker 1990 messick 1980 messick & jungeblut 1981 powers 1993 powers & rock 1999 .\\none problem for research on sat coaching has been that coaching effect estimates are usually based on studies with observational designs making causal inference about coaching effects equivocal. typically there is reason to believe that coached students self-select themselves on the basis of higher levels of motivation or academic ability. to the extent that such variables are themselves correlated with sat performance an estimated coaching effect will suffer from selection bias. when certain assumptions hold the heckman model is a statistical approach that could be used in such a scenario to estimate an asymptotically unbiased effect of coaching. i

species. we developed an urban growth model sprawl evaluated it with hindcasting and used it to simulate urban growth across the northeastern united states between 2010 and 2080 under four alternative scenarios. in the model urban growth is constrained by demand for new development for each time step at the subregional scale. demand is subsequently allocated to local application panes 5 km on a side within 15 km window using a unique landscape context matching algorithm such that the more historical development that occurred in the matched training windows the higher the proportion of future

sprawl has a multi-level multi-scale structure that captures urban growth drivers operating at multiple scales and when combined with the unique matching and suitability algorithms induces non-stationarity in urban growth across time and space. our evaluation indicated that sprawl was highly discriminatory well-calibrated and highly predictive of new development but performed weakly for

achievement nationwide. these tests showed black and hispanic students to be roughly four years behind white students on average by age seventeen. in addition the 1970s saw large numbers of blacks and hispanics seeking college admission and scoring approximately a standard deviation behind whites on the sat.\\nover the ensuing years data from the naep the sat and increasingly common state and district testing programs continued to show a racial gap in achievement. scholars debated its causes-family peer groups culture discrimination heredity and schooling. policymakers lamented its intractability. gains made by blacks and hispanics from the late 1970s to the late 1980s on national measures eroded in the 1990s. and these declines occurred during perhaps the most aggressive era of school reform in the nation\\'s history. a fair conclusion as the definitive volume on the subject the black-white test score gap edited by christopher jencks and meredith phillips reached in 1998 is that far more is known about the nature of the achievement gap-its causes and its consequences-than about how to fix it.\\nthe situation however may finally be changing. achievement trends discouraging as they may be do not give a complete picture of developments in student achievement. around the country a number of specific efforts are showing that the achievement gap can be bridged. schools and school reforms are boosting the achievement of hispanic and especially african american students to levels nearing those of whites. disparate in approach and involving relatively few students these efforts are nonetheless important. they are potentially replicable. they offer lessons that might be learned and applied widely. they offer hope that the achievement gap might one day soon be reduced meaningfully. this book provides for the first time in one place the evidence of these efforts-evidence that when taken together is remarkably encouraging.\\nover a decade ago the state of tennessee launched one of the most important experiments in education reform to investigate the effects of class size on student achievement. project star was designed as a large-scale experiment with random assignment of students to treatment and control groups that is to classes of regular or small size or regular size with a teacher\\'s aide. it represented the most powerful of research designs and a rarity in public policy-everyone eligible for a new policy benefit in this case a smaller class wants or expects to receive it. class-size reduction also happens to be one of the more popular albeit expensive reforms being implemented in school systems throughout america today.\\nin their chapter \"would smaller classes help close the black-white achievement gap?\" alan b. krueger and diane m. whitmore put the data from project star to what might be considered the ultimate test. the students in the project who were in grades k-3 when they experienced different sized classes have now either finished high school or dropped out. krueger and whitmore explore the long-term effects of smaller classes on student achievement. they found that while all types of students enrolled in smaller classes achieved at higher levels than students enrolled in regular classes with or without aides during the years they were in grades k-3 the achievement advantage of smaller classes largely disappeared for white students once they returned to regular-size classes in fourth grade. for black students however the achievement advantage diminished in grade four but then stabilized at about 5 national percentiles over the long haul reducing the black-white achievement gap for those students by 15 percent. what is more the advantages of smaller classes showed up in participation rates of taking the sat and the american college test act. black students enrolled in smaller classes in their primary years took college entrance exams years later at an 8 percent higher rate than black students in regular classes. this amounts to more than a 50 percent reduction in the black-white gap in college entrance exam participation-and a potentially significant reduction in differences in college attendance rates for blacks and whites.\\nthese differences are to be taken seriously because they are enduring products of well-designed experimental interventions. but class size is not the only reform for which experimental evidence is becoming available. school vouchers a reform of arguably the greatest potential significance have been implemented through randomized field trials in multiple settings over the last five years. vouchers which entitle students to attend any public or private school willing to accept the voucher for all or part of the cost of attendance could stimulate dramatic change in america\\'s schools. poorly performing schools could easily lose all of their students and revenue as students choose to use their vouchers to go elsewhere. schools offering quality education whether public or private existing or entirely new would flourish. vouchers could bring about change not only in the practices of schools as they seek to maintain or build enrollment but also in the mix of schools in existence.\\nthe effects of vouchers are hardly a simple matter to predict. families could make poor choices. poor families and poorly educated families including the families of many black and hispanic youngsters could make the worst choices. schools could cater to families without improving education.',

empirical section of the paper we use the high school and beyond hsb data set to examine the effects of retention on the probability of dropping out of high school and on labor market earnings several years after the student has entered the workforce. this empirical work adds to the existent literature on grade school retention in several dimensions. first the data set is nationally representative and thereby provides some generality that is lacking in much of the current literature which typically consists of case studies of individual schools or districts. second since the hsb is a panel of students tracked since their sophomore year in 1980 up to 1992 we are able to examine the relatively long-run impact of retention on eventual labor market earnings which no previous study has been able to measure. third we account for the endogeneity of grade retention by using instrumental variables iv estimation where the key instrument is based on exogenous variation across states in

hypertrophy but cavity size does not change. although left ventricular systolic function is preserved across the age span early diastolic filling rate declines 30-50% between the third and ninth

2003 both of which made landfall within 100 km of the mouth of the bay. the model results agree reasonably well with field observations of water level velocity and salinity. from the bay's water level response to the hurricanes it was found that the storm surge in the bay has two distinct stages: an initial stage set up by the remote winds and the second stage -a primary surge induced by the local winds. for the initial stage the rising of the coastal sea level was setup by the remote wind of both hurricanes similarly but for the second stage the responses to the two hurricanes' local winds are significantly different. hurricane floyd was followed by down-bay winds that canceled the initial setup and caused a set-down from the upper bay. hurricane isabel on the other hand was followed by up-bay winds which reinforced the initial setup and continued to rise up against the head of the bay. from the perspective of volume and salt fluxes it is evident that an oceanic saltwater influx is pushed into the bay from the continental shelf by the remote wind fields in the initial stages of the storm surge for both floyd and isabel. in the second stage after the hurricane made landfall the bay's local wind plays a key role in modulating the salinity and velocity fields through vertical mixing and longitudinal salt transport. controlled numerical experiments are conducted in order to identify and differentiate the roles played by the local wind in stratified and destratified conditions. down-estuary local wind stress of hurricane floyd-type tends to enhance stratification under moderate winds but exhibits an increasing-then-decreasing stage when the wind stress increases. the up-estuary local wind stress of hurricane isabel-type tends to penetrate deeper into the water column which reduces stratification by reversing gravitational circulation. to characterize mixing conditions in the estuary a modified horizontal richardson number that incorporates wind stress wind

'introduction prostate cancer pca and prostate specific antigen psa screening have been the main focus of discussions among urologists and primary care physicians during the last few years 1 . ever

mainly relating to reduction in cancer-specific mortality. several retrospective reports such as the surveillance epidemiology and end results seer database review suggested a significant decline in mortality rates of 32.5% from pca due to screening the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa showed that psa levels increased years before clinically detectable pca and that this could lead to an effective early diagnosis and more effective therapy 5 . similar findings were observed in the study from tyrol austria where men from this particular region had a notable decrease in mortality after being screened with psa in comparison to the rest of the country where psa testing was not freely available 6 . however in 2009 two large randomized prospective studies attempted to answer this decade-long question: the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial plco from the united states which showed no benefit to screening 7 8  and the european randomized trial of screening for prostate cancer erspc which reported a 20% reduction in mortality from pca but at the expense of 1410 men having to undergo screening and additional 48 men to undergo treatment in order to save 1 life [9] [10] [11] . the latter results implied a significant overtreatment and overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant cancers as a result of screening. although survival rates after radical management of localized pca are high the risk of complications including urinary sexual and bowel dysfunction is not negligible 12 13 . based on these findings the united states preventive services task force uspstf after careful review and balance of the risks and benefits -mainly problems of overdiagnosis and over-treatment -recommended against a population-based screening program 14

created a conflicting and confusing environment for the world-wide treating physicians and their patients. while many questions still remain unanswered psa although an imperfect test continues to be

families and child wellbeing study-a longitudinal study of an urban u.s. cohort of nearly 5000 children born between 1998 and 2000. participating mothers were asked at baseline and again in one-and three-year follow-up surveys about their social and demographic characteristics their and their partners' childbearing with other partners and their perceived level of social support. three types of support were examined: whether women believed that if they were in need someone would loan them $200 provide them with a place to live or help them with babysitting or child care. the researchers pooled all three waves of data and they excluded records from mothers who did not respond to a follow-up survey and records that were missing data the final sample consisted of 12259 records. logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the independent relationships between social and demographic characteristics multipartnered fertility and perceived support.\\non average mothers were 28 years old and had had two children. forty-one percent were black 28% were white and 25% were hispanic half had had some postsecondary education. nineteen percent of mothers were immigrants 6% reported being in poor health and 49% had lived with both parents at age 15. about one-third 30% of mothers and one-third 33% of fathers had had children with a prior partner. overall mothers' perceived level

associated with perceiving all three types of support odds ratio 0.7 each increased parity was associated with reduced odds of perceiving social support as well 0.8. when social and demographic variables were added to the model the associations for mother's and father's multipartnered fertility weakened 0.8 and 0.7 but remained significant. most of the social and demographic variables were significant: having a high school diploma or some college being white or hispanic and having lived with both parents at age 15 were positively associated with perceived support 1.2-1.9 whereas being an immigrant and being in poor health were negatively associated with the outcome 0.5 and 0.6 respectively. finally when variables pertaining to the relationship between the mother and the father were added to the model the associations for mother's and father's multipartnered fertility were further reduced 0.9 and 0.8 but remained significant. three of the four relationship variables were significantly associated with perceived support: being married or cohabiting 1.4 each and being estranged 0.7. all social and demographic variables that were significant in the second model remained

woman's perception of all three types of support 0.7-0.8.\\nto investigate the causal direction of the association between multipartnered fertility and perceived support the researchers first

follow-up a disproportionate share 14% had experienced multipartnered fertility between surveys. in multivariate analyses women who had perceived all three types of support at the one-year survey were less likely than those who had not to have experienced multipartnered fertility between surveys odds ratio 0.6. the evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship in which multipartnered fertility reduces the availability of support and the availability of support inhibits multipartnered fertility.\\nthe authors acknowledge that a limitation of their analyses was that they relied on women's perceived level of support which may have been different than the true amount of support available to women. nevertheless the authors comment that ''as a result of multipartnered fertility children

support resulting from multipartnered fertility may contribute to racial inequality and to inequality across family structures.''-j. rosenberg reference examination survey which uses a nationally representative sample of noninstitutionalized u.s. women aged 14-59. self-collected cervicovaginal samples taken at a mobile examination center were tested for hpv dna and data were collected on

personal characteristics were assessed using the wald chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis which was limited to women aged 18-59.\\ntwenty-seven percent of surveyed females tested positive for hpv using 2000 census data the researchers calculate that this represents nearly 25 million infected individuals. the highest rate of infection was among 20-24-year-olds 45% of whom were infected prevalence was 20% among those aged 50-59 and 25-28% among other agegroups. prevalence increased with each year between the ages of 14 and 24. among sexually active females 49% of those aged 20-24 were infected as were 40% of those aged 14-19 rates were lower for women 25 or older. overall 39% of blacks tested positive as did 24% of whites and mexican americans. hpv prevalence differed depending on marital status: 46% among those who lived with a partner 41% among those who were widowed divorced or separated 31% among those who had never married and 17% among those who were married. prevalence decreased from 35% among females who had not graduated from high school to 25% among those with any postsecondary education. thirty-eight percent of those living below the poverty index tested positive as did 24% of those at or above the index.\\nfifteen percent of all surveyed females were infected with a high-risk hpv type and 18% were infected with a low-risk type rates of both types were highest among those aged 20-24. infection with high-risk types decreased after age 29 and infection with low-risk types leveled off after age 39. the hpv types that can be prevented by the fda-approved vaccine were found in 0.1-1.5% of females overall 3.4% tested positive for at least one of these types. sixty percent of females who had any hpv infection had only one type of the virus 24% had two and 16% had three or more.\\nmultivariate logistic regression analysis of data on women aged 18-59 found a number of factors to be independently associated with hpv infection. women aged 20-24 were more likely than those 30 or older to be infected odds ratio 2.2. marital status was a significant predictor of infection: compared with married women those who were formerly married never-married or living with a partner had higher odds of being infected 3.1 2.2 and 3.4 respectively. furthermore women who had had three or more lifetime sexual partners had higher odds of being infected than those with a single lifetime partner 2.7 and compared with women who had had no partners in the last year those who had had one two or three or more sexual partners in the last year had elevated odds 2.1 4.0 and 4.1 respectively.\\nthe researchers note several limitations of their study. women who declined to participate were more likely than respondents to be of ''other'' race or ethnicity to be younger than 40 to have been born outside the united states or mexico and to have never had sex. also cervicovaginal samples may not detect the same hpv types as cervical mucosa samples collected in other studies and prevalence rates determined by dna tests underestimate the cumulative incidence of hpv because these tests do not indicate past exposure. nonetheless the researchers state that this is the first study to provide a national estimate over a broad age range and they believe that its findings will be useful in assessing ''the wide-scale impact of the vaccine for reducing infection and could help guide models evaluating impact and cost-effectiveness.''-j. thomas low-income women who suffer from chronic psychosocial stress are at increased risk of having a low-birth-weight baby according to findings from a study of illinois welfare recipients. 1 overall 13% of women who gave birth during the course of the study delivered a low-birth-weight infant but the proportion was significantly elevated among those who reported a variety of stressors. for example it was 31% among those who had difficulty affording food for their household and 34% among those who had poor skills for coping with external stressors. multivariate analyses confirmed that these and other stressors were independently associated with the likelihood of having a low-birth-weight baby. the sample was derived from a cohort of women participating in a longitudinal study of the maternal and child health effects of making the transition from welfare to work. members of the larger cohort had been randomly selected from among families in nine counties who received temporary assistance for needy families in 1998 participants were interviewed annually from 1999 to 2004. to examine associations between psychosocial stress and low birth weight defined as less than 2500 g researchers identified women in the cohort who had singleton births during the first four years of the study and analyzed data collected within six months of delivery.\\nof the 294 women who made up the analytic sample 77% were black 16% were white 5% were hispanic and the rest were members of other racial or ethnic groups. the women ranged in age from 19 to 47 twothirds were 26 or younger. among women who reported their household income the mean income was $13416. thirteen percent of women had low-birth-weight infants these women were significantly older than others 28 vs. 25 years on average but the groups did not differ with respect to any other demographic characteristics examined race or ethnicity education parity marital status and recent gap in health insurance.\\nin univariate analyses the proportion of women whose infants were low-birth-weight was significantly related to five of 16 psychosocial stressors studied. it was 17% among unemployed women 23% among those living in crowded housing 27% among those who had a child with a chronic illness 31% among those who had difficulty paying for the household's food and 34% among those with poor coping skills. among women not reporting these stressors by contrast only 6-12% had low-birth-weight babies.\\nexcept for home crowdedness each of these stressors remained significantly associated with a woman's likelihood of having a low-birth-weight baby in analyses controlling for maternal age. odds ratios ranged from 2.6 for food insecurity to 4.0 for poor coping skills.\\nthe researchers note that the finding of a positive relationship between maternal age and the frequency of low birth weight contradicts earlier findings for the general population. by way of explanation they suggest that maternal age is a ''proxy'' for chronic stressors that are difficult to measure and that the relationship is evidence of the ''cumulative adverse effects of chronic psychosocial stress'' among low-income women. a better understanding of the association between chronic stress and low birth weight they conclude ''may allow the development of more effective risk assessment measures or even interventions that could mitigate the damaging effects of the stress response'' in low-income women.-d. hollander \", 'a2819615-ad35-4d49-9f6d-576e5c9bd958': \"abstract csef university of salerno daniela vuri university of florence child and iza\\nwords\\nin this paper we analyse data from the

assessment of registration quality in large clinical datasets is inefficient. in this work we propose to automatically assess the quality of registration to an atlas in clinical flair mri scans of the brain. the method consists of automatically segmenting the ventricles of a given scan using a neural network and comparing the segmentation to the atlas ventricles propagated to image space. we used the proposed method to improve clinical image registration to a general atlas by computing multiple registrations -one directly to the general atlas and others via different agespecific atlases -and then selecting the registration that yielded the highest ventricle overlap. finally as an example application of the complete pipeline a voxelwise map of white matter hyperintensity burden was computed using only the scans with registration quality above a predefined threshold. methods were evaluated in a single-site dataset of more than 1000 scans as well as a multicenter dataset comprising 142 clinical scans from 12 sites. the automated ventricle segmentation reached a dice coefficient with manual annotations of 0.89 in the single-site dataset and 0.83 in the multi-center

maximum sustained wind speeds of 40 mph 65 kph prompting the nhc to name the disturbance tropical storm harvey. atmospheric conditions for further development of the storm were marginal as warm sea surface temperatures were offset by moderate vertical wind shear. however harvey continued to track in a general westward direction as it moved through the lesser antilles including directly across barbados and st. vincent on august 18 at tropical storm strength.\\nthe following day nhc meteorologists noted that the structure of harvey had deteriorated based on a ragged-looking storm evident in satellite imagery see image on the right while a hurricane hunter mission found a much weakened system with a closed circulation only evident at very low levels in the atmosphere. through august 19 wind shear continued to tear apart the storm and by the late afternoon it had been downgraded to a tropical depression. the track motion continued in a general westnorthwestward direction across the caribbean sea toward belize and mexico.\\nat this time the forecast computer models showed significant bifurcation: one set of models predicted that wind shear would subside in 24 hours allowing major re-intensification of harvey prior to it making landfall over belize or mexico\\'s yucatan peninsula the other set of models showed that the structure of the storm had decayed so severely that it would not be able to regenerate itself despite atmospheric conditions becoming significantly more favorable.\\nlate on august 19 the nhc reported that harvey had degenerated to such an extent that it was now considered an \"open wave\" and as a result they ceased issuing advisories on the system. the wave continued to track over the open waters of the western caribbean sea before later crossing the yucatan peninsula on august 22.\\nthe nhc continued to monitor the wave as it emerged in the bay of campeche and harvey\\'s remnants almost immediately began to re-intensify over very warm sea surface temperatures. the agency began issuing advisories once again on august 23 as a hurricane hunter mission found a closed low-level circulation center. the system remained disorganized with an asymmetric pattern evident in satellite imagery despite atmospheric conditions over the western gulf of mexico being very favorable. the warm sea surface temperatures combined with low levels of vertical wind shear to allow harvey to regain its structure and rapidly intensify. in their first advisory on august 23 the nhc first noted the potential for harvey to make landfall as a hurricane-strength system over the u.s. state of texas.\\nas harvey moved over the western gulf of mexico it turned and took a more northerly track for roughly 24 hours through august 24-25 as the system began to strengthen its inner core given the very favorable atmospheric and oceanic conditions. early on august 24 it was once again upgraded as tropical storm harvey for the second time. intensification of the system occurred more quickly than forecast and just 12 hours later hurricane harvey was named with maximum sustained wind speeds of 85 mph 140 kph based on data measured by a hurricane hunter.\\nas harvey attained hurricane intensity its track once again changed direction and it turned to the northnorthwest and toward the texas coast as the steering currents altered. the intensification rate of the system slowed slightly through the late hours of august 24 but aircraft reconnaissance missions on august 25 continued to find a more powerful cyclone. in fact the aircraft data found that the system had intensified into a category 2 storm with 105 mph 165 kph winds. this strengthening was clearly evident given an improved satellite signature. a deep strong ring of convection around an intermittent eye feature indicated that the storm was responding to a very favorable atmosphere.\\nby the late morning of august 25 local national weather service nws offices in brownsville and corpus christi began observing harvey via doppler radar scans. it was determined that the hurricane had developed a pair of concentric eyewalls. the nhc noted that the concentric eyewalls were proving problematic for their intensity forecasts due to the potential for an eyewall replacement cycle to occur. during an eyewall replacement cycle the intensity of a hurricane generally decreases or stays stable while the extent of the wind field increases. the agency continued to warn of the prodigious amount of rainfall expected to fall across a broad swath of east texas and western louisiana given the size of harvey regardless of how intense the storm may be at landfall. at this point the weather prediction center wpc was warning of the possibility of up to 30 inches 762 millimeters of rain falling in a fiveday span.\\ndespite the presence of the concentric eyewalls harvey continued to intensify through august 25 as its wind speeds increased and central pressure plummeted. during this time harvey was traversing over a deep and warm eddy of water. these conditions helped the cyclone become a major hurricane during the afternoon of august 25. in another flight

landfall into texas at approximately 10:00 pm cdt local time 03:00 utc august 26 as a 130 mph 215 kph category 4 strength hurricane. landfall location was near the town of rockport texas which is located between port aransas and port o\\'connor.\\nthe storm would continue to slow its forward progress after its initial landfall while tracking directly over rockport and causing extensive wind

category 3 system. throughout the day on august 26 harvey very gradually began to weaken and lose its wind speed intensity. the storm ceased to contain hurricane-force winds during the afternoon but maintained an impressive appearance on satellite. numerous incredibly intense bands of heavy rain and isolated tornadoes accompanied the bands of rain that led to multiple flash flood emergencies -including in the greater houston metro region. the slow-moving nature of the system prompted the wpc to indicate that isolated areas of texas could see upwards of 50 inches 1270 millimeters. this did occur.\\nharvey maintained minimal tropical storm-force winds while meandering back into the gulf of mexico. the nhc only expected minimal if any intensification primarily due to sea surface temperatures being much cooler given recent upwelling and the intrusion of dry air into harvey\\'s core. the storm eventually made its final landfall near cameron louisiana on august 30 around 3:00 am 8:00 utc with 45 mph 75 kph winds. despite the lack of strong intensification the storm continued to bring relentless heavy rainfall to parts of texas and louisiana. harvey was expected to finally lose its tropical characteristics by september 2 while its remnants tracked into the ohio valley and northeast. despite future dissipation it will take at least a week for flood waters and river levels to recede to normal.\\nbelow is a graphic that shows maximum rainfall totals caused by tropical cyclones -and their remnantsfor each lower 48 state dating to 1950. harvey broke the continental

development of chronic disease is often a lifechanging event with significant physiological social and psychological consequences. as such developing a severe illness and living with the burden of disease could both lead to long-term changes in self-perception. although psychological factors such as personality traits have been implicated in the development of disease deary weiss & batty 2010  whether getting sick and enduring chronic illness contributes to personality change is notably understudied in the personality development literature but see lüdtke roberts trautwein & nagy 2011 steunenberg twisk beekman deeg & kerkhof 2005 . to that end this study addresses two major questions about the reciprocal nature of personality traits and illness burden: a are personality traits associated with an increased risk of significant disease? and b as people develop significant illness does their personality change? a secondary goal of this research is to examine whether the associations between personality and illness vary by demographic factors age sex ethnicity and education and to test factors that may contribute to these associations. using the five-factor model ffm of personality as an organizing framework we address these questions in a large community sample of urban-dwelling adults.\\npersonality traits have long been known to contribute to disease states and disease progression. the early type a literature linked a hostile and aggressive personality to cardiovascular outcomes such as heart attack and stroke williams et al. 1980 . later research identified interpersonal hostility as the driving characteristic of the association between type a behavior and cardiovascular disease macdougall dembroski dimsdale & hackett 1985 . recent work has demonstrated that other ffm traits in addition to low agreeableness are associated with illness. for example higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness have been found to predict aggregate morbidity chapman roberts lyness & duberstein in press and self-rated health . the same traits are also associated with increased risk for specific diseases goodwin & friedman 2006  such as major depression kendler & myers 2010  and alzheimer's disease terracciano et al. in press wilson schneider arnold bienias & bennett 2007 . personality traits are also associated with disease progression. among those living with hiv for example disease progression is slower for more open extraverted and conscientious individuals ironson o'cleirigh weiss schneiderman & costa 2008 .\\nthe longitudinal relation between personality and disease is typically conceived of as personality as a predictor of the onset of disease. there is reason to suspect however that disease could likewise have an effect on personality development. a sudden change in personality or other psychological factors may be one of the first indictors of acute disease. for example a severe spike in high blood pressure is often detected because of sudden changes in personality and increased irritability mayo clinic 2012 . patients who are ultimately diagnosed with lyme disease often present with irritability depression and attention deficits czupryna et al. 2011 . once the acute phase of the disease is treated the psychological changes associated with the disease usually return to normal. in contrast individuals suffering from chronic diseases may face permanent changes to their personality. for example compared with before the onset of disease patients with alzheimer's are described as more neurotic and less extraverted and less conscientious by their caregivers pocnet rossier antonietti & von gunten 2011 .\\nin addition to the physiological changes that occur with chronic illness the tremendous lifestyles changes that accompany disease may feed back on to how individuals perceive themselves. chronic disease can have a widespread effect on nearly every aspect of the individual's life. disease impairs mobility guralnik et al. 1993  places burden on loved ones emanuel fairclough slutsman & emanuel 2000  and can be financially devastating wolff starfield & anderson 2002 . for someone suffering from a chronic disease all of these factors over time may have lasting effects on personality. for example dependence on a caregiver may lead the individual to perceive himself as less competent and less capable than when he/she was independent. yet whether disease burden and increases in burden are associated with changes in personality have yet to be explored.\\nthis study uses a large community-based sample to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal relations between personality traits and illness burden. given that high neuroticism and low conscientiousness are associated with specific diseases goodwin & friedman 2006  increases in comorbidity over time chapman et al. in press  declines in physical functioning jaconelli stephan canada & chapman 2012  and premature mortality terracciano löckenhoff zonderman ferrucci & costa 2008 wilson mendes de leon bienias evans & bennett 2004  we expected these two traits to be associated with greater illness burden when measured concurrently and to confer greater risk for developing disease over time.\\nto date the research on personality and illness burden has focused almost exclusively on domain-level associations. yet the five broad domains include a number of relatively heterogeneous specific traits or facets that do not always follow their factor-level associations. these narrower traits tend to have greater predictive power than the broad domains paunonen haddock forsterling & keinonen 2003  and facet-level associations can sometimes go in opposite directions obscuring the effect at the broad domain level. thus to fully understand the relation between personality traits and illness burden it is informative to examine these associations at the more specific facet level in addition to the broad domains. a number of these more specific traits have been linked to factors that increase risk for poor health. impulsivity-related traits for example have been associated with obesity sutin ferrucci zonderman & terracciano 2011 van hout van oudheusden & van heck 2004  inflammation sutin terracciano deiana naitza et al. 2010  and health-risk behaviors such as cigarette smoking and other substance use mitchell 1999 turiano whiteman hampson roberts & mroczek 2012 . depression-related scales have likewise been associated with indices of poor health  whereas those who are less moody and more cheerful andersen et al. 2012 and those who have a disposition to be active tend to exercise more tend to fare better as they age and live longer terracciano löckenhoff zonderman et al. 2008 . thus we expected the traits that reflect the different aspects of trait impulsivity n5: impulsiveness e5: excitement-seeking low c5: selfdiscipline and low c6: deliberation and depression n3: depression n6: vulnerability to be associated with greater illness burden measured concurrently and with greater risk for developing disease over time whereas there should be a reduced risk for those high on e4: activity.\\ngiven the dearth of research on illness burden and changes in personality there is less evidence to draw from to make hypotheses for how disease will shape personality development. we can however draw from related literatures to make preliminary predictions about these relations. as described previously inflammatory processes contribute to depression and illness can place limits on the individual's ability to socialize and be active. further experimental findings suggest that some people become more conservative when primed with thoughts of death nail mcgregor drinkwater steele & thompson 2009 . therefore we expected that the development of disease would be associated with increases in neuroticism and declines in extraversion and openness.\",

increased depressive symptoms 3 years before the diagnosis of ad and geerlings et al 8 suggest that depression may be an early symptom or subclinical expression of dementia in more highly educated

socioeconomic status has on educational outcomes for low-income minority youth. information gleaned from national longitudinal data sets such as the national education longitudinal study the panel study of income dynamics the national longitudinal survey of youth and the national survey of families and households have significantly contributed to our knowledge of the impact of socioeconomic status on school performance and educational attainment for racial and ethnic minorities e.g. national center for education statistics 2001b . we now know for exam-ple that the timing and duration of poverty has serious implications for children's cognitive development and that the critical period wherein a child's experience of poverty has the most deleterious effect on long-term school performance is from birth to five brooks-gunn & duncan 1997 . research has also established that children who experience poverty particularly persistent poverty during their preschool and early school years have lower rates of school completion than children and adolescents who experience poverty only in later years aber bennett conley & li 1997 brooks-gunn & duncan 1997 and that the lives of

spacecraft or an upper stage has been a long standing method for accomplishing stability and pointing accuracy of the spacecraft with a minimum of hardware complexity and expense. while spinning a deployed spacecraft over its operational lifetime has generally fallen out of style in favor of the more modern three axis stabilized active systems popular today there still is a community of users that have to deal with spin stabilized upper stage dynamics. many nasa and dod payloads are launched on boeing delta ii expendable launch vehicles with a spinning solid rocket third stage. this particular version of the delta ii has been very popular for nasa interplanetary missions. because of this nasa\\'s expendable launch vehicle program office at kennedy space center has been investigating ways to improve their understanding and ability to model spinning upper stage dynamics. while this research work has important near term applications for expendable launch vehicles it also has significant implications for nasa\\'s future manned space program. spinning a large manned vehicle or perhaps segments of one connected by a long tether is the only practical way to obtain \"artificial gravity\". long duration space missions may require some form of artificial gravity to counteract the effects of extended weightlessness on the human body.\\nliquid slosh in the fuel tanks of an attached spacecraft has been a long standing concern for space missions with a spinning upper stage. energy loss through the movement of the liquid fuel in the fuel tank affects the gyroscopic stability of the combined spacecraft and upper stage. energy loss leads to an ever increasing wobble or \"nutation\" which can grow to cause severe control issues [1] . the more vigorous the slosh the greater the energy loss and hence the greater the nutation. the \"nutation angle\" is defined as the angular displacement between the principal axis of rotation of the spacecraft and its angular momentum vector and is a measurement of the magnitude of the nutation [12] . the amount of time it takes for the angle of the nutation to increase by a factor of e\\' is defined as the nutation time constant ntc and is a primary factor in the determination of the long term stability of the spinning spacecraft during the upper stage burn. the ntc can sometimes be very tedious to calculate and very inaccurate if calculated during the early stages of spacecraft design.\\nthere is a high degree of uncertainty in predicting the effect of liquid fuel motion in spinning spacecraft. the resulting nutation growth can be excessive and can pose a threat to the mission. missions have been lost because of excessive and unanticipated nutation growth explorer i 1958 and ats-5 1969 being early examples. purely analytical methods of predicting the influence of onboard liquids have been generally unsatisfactory [1] . the ntc values provided analytically are quite often significantly different than actual flight values. hence there is a need to identify conditions of resonance between nutational motion and liquid modes and to understand the general characteristics-of the liquid-motion that cause the problem in spinning spacecraft. the proposed research is a first step in trying to understand and model certain modes of induced resonance found during experimental testing and during flight. this study will focus on the modeling of fluid motion and will utilize the results obtained to develop a more accurate prediction of the fuel slosh effects on spin stabilization of spacecraft.\\nduring the initial design of spacecraft use of purely analytical means of predicting the influence of onboard liquids has not worked well. computational fluid dynamics software packages provide some insight but it turns out that they have several shortcomings. their complexity and inability to accurately model the coupling effects of sloshing mass on the six degree-of-freedom motion experienced by the spacecraft make their application problematic.\\nliquid oscillations in spinning tanks have been studied in the past. liquid oscillations in spinning fuel tanks produce very different response characteristics compared to those of non-spinning fuel tanks [3] . an energy sink model was originally developed by thomson [4] to include the effects of small passive sources of energy dissipation. this model does not work well for spacecraft fuel slosh energy dissipation due to the fact that fuel mass is a large fraction of the total mass of the spacecraft.\\nextensive analysis has been done on the different tank shapes and locations as well as the use of propellant management devices pmd. a summary of this analysis like that reported by hubert [11] shows the vast differences in possible behaviors of different designs. for the off-spin-axis-mounted cylindrical tanks with hemispherical end-caps that have been popular in a number of spacecraft programs a number of relatively simple mechanical models have been developed. hubert also notes that one of the most difficult aspects of employing such mechanical models is in the selection of appropriate parameters in the model.\\nuse of mechanical analogs such as pendulums and rotors to simulate sloshing mass is a common alternative to fluid modeling. a homogeneous vortex model of liquid motions in spinning tanks and an equivalent mechanical rotor model was developed by dodge et al. [5] . an approximate theory of oscillations that predicts the characteristics of the dominant inertial wave oscillation and the forces and moments on the tank are described. according to dodge et al. the pendulum model simulates a motion that does not involve an oscillation of the center american institute of aeronautics and astronautics of mass. therefore it is not a valid model of inertial wave oscillations. weihs and dodge [6] illustrate that the free surface effects can be ignored when the liquid depth is small.\\na 3-d pendulum model was proposed by green et al. [7] . there was evidence of liquid resonance from the experimental data. the resonance was closely tied to the tangential torque and to a lesser degree to the radial torque and there was little or no resonance in the force measurements. green at al. proposed a rotary oscillator concept to simulate the torque resonance in tangential and radial directions. this rotary oscillator model was superimposed on the pendulum model to provide the overall response of liquid oscillation in the tank.\\nthe current research effort proposed is directed toward modeling the resonance in fuel slosh of spinning spacecraft using simple pendulum analogs. the pendulum analog will model a spherical tank with no pmd\\'s. an electric motor will induce the motion of the pendulum to simulate free surface slosh. parameters describing the simple pendulum models will characterize the resonant modes of free surface sloshing motion. the one degree of freedom model will help to understand the fuel slosh resonance and serve as a stepping stone for future more complex simulations to predict the ntc accurately with less time and effort.', 'b08e8a11-0c6b-4638-affa-7888a357cfa0': \"introduction prostate

1980  that generates hurricane force winds using a prescribed track minimum surface pressure and radius of maximum winds. a final application of winds in the pctides system is the input of a single value for wind speed over the entire domain which can vary temporally but not spatially and is referred to as \"manual winds\" in the system. pctides is a depth-integrated barotropic hydrodynamic

and y directions respectively h is the total depth \" is the surface elevation f is the coriolis parameter g is the acceleration due to gravity p is the atmospheric surface pressure p is the water

wave radiation stresses. 4 the equations have been formulated on a cartesian grid due to the relative ease of coding. however the formulation is generalized to incorporate different map projections through the appropriate specification of the map factor m a scaling factor dependent on the chosen map projection of the model grid. in accordance with this generality the coriolis parameter varies with latitude.\\nthe surface wind stress components are computed using the quadratic relationship:\\nwhere ua i n 1.5\\nthe bottom stress is represented by a manning\\'s n depth-dependent friction relation following signell and butman 1992:\\nwhere n has the value 0.03. this formulation ensures that the drag coefficient increases with decreasing water depth and is applied to water depths greater than 1 m. in extremely shallow water and over land points that become inundated drag coefficients can be specified at each grid-point according to the terrain type.\\nboundary conditions can be applied in a range of ways depending on the type of process being modeled. meteorological forcing is applied via the wind stress and surface pressure gradient terms in equations 1.1 to 1.3 at all submerged model grid-points in the computational domain.\\ntidal and meteorological forcing at lateral boundaries is achieved by specifying the incremental displacement of the water surface due to changes in tidal height and atmospheric barometric displacement. the lateral boundary conditions are applied using a \"one-way nesting\" technique. the boundary conditions are applied to the appropriate model variable 0 representing height or velocity with decreasing intensity from the 5 boundary to some specified number of model grid-points typically around 12 into the domain according to the following equation\\nwhere op is the model predicted value and b is the prescribed boundary value and a is varied according to a cosine function such that a= 0.5cos r1-nb/nmax +1 n=l nfl\\nat coastal boundaries and along riverbanks the wetting and drying of grid cells is accomplished via the inundation algorithm described in the next section. on outflow a radiation boundary condition as described in miller and thorpe 1981 is applied to the velocity field to prevent the build up of wave energy within the numerical domain while on inflow boundaries a zero-gradient condition is applied.\\nunder any prescribed boundary forcing pctides is initialized by setting velocities to zero and interpolates the global finite element solutions versions 99 fes 99 lefevre et al. 2000 elevation field to the model grid. it is customary to allocate an initial spin-up period to allow the effects of the boundary forcing and tidal conditions to propagate throughout the computational domain. sensitivity studies conclude that an appropriate spin-up time for pctides using wind forcing is 24 hours and without wind forcing is 12 hours.\\nthe adjustment of coastlines to account for flooding and draining takes place after equations 1.1-1.3 have been solved as described above. the coastal boundary is configured to pass through the velocity grid-points on the staggered grid in a stepwise manner such that it passes through the u points in the y-direction and through v points in the x-direction. the velocities on the boundaries are assumed to be zero.\\nthe first step is to calculate the distance in the x-and y-directions that fluid could travel in a time step at each ý grid-point that is adjacent to the coast. the depth-averaged current velocity used in this calculation is taken at the first grid-point on the seaward side of the ý grid-point. the travel distance is:\\nwhere ax\"j and ay\"-\\' are the distances in the x and y directions that the water traveled in the previous time step. by factoring in the travel time of the fluid inland grid cells are prevented from automatically becoming inundated at the first instant the water level at the coast exceeds the height of the adjacent dry points. in equations 1.9 and 1.10 the first option applies to flooding in the positive x or y direction or draining in the negative x and y direction while the second option applies to flooding in the negative x and y direction or draining in the positive x and y direction.\\nthe testing for coastline movement proceeds in the x-and y-directions separately. if the height of the water at the first z-point seaward of the coastline exceeds the topographic height at the first z-point landward of it and the accumulated distance traveled in the given direction exceeds the grid separation then a new sea-point is added to the computational domain. the velocity at the newly acquired velocity point is extrapolated from adjacent points and the continuity equation is solved to obtain the water depth at the new height point. finally ax\"~j and ay.j are set to zero.\\nthe procedure for draining is similar. if the height of the fluid at the height point adjacent the boundary drops below some arbitrary positive height e and the accumulated distance traveled by the fluid exceeds the grid length then draining is assumed to have occurred. the height grid-point is reclassified as dry i.e. ý=0 and the boundary relocated to the adjacent wet velocity grid-point. examples of the performance of the inundation algorithm can be found in hubbert and mclnnes 1999a b.\\nin order to improve the simulation of tidal forced dynamics a facility is included to \"nudge\" the model solution with tidal height predictions at tidal stations within the model domain. global tidal station constituent data is stored in ascii format in the file tcanals.dat. new stations can easily be added to this file in the appropriate format.\\nduring a model run the tcanals.dat file is scanned by subroutine tideobs during its first call and the tidal constituent parameters for stations within the model domain are stored. at each model time step the tidal height is predicted at each station and used to \"nudge\" the model solution.\\nthe nudging method is based on deriving a new solution at grid points near each tidal station from a weighted combination of the model solution and the station sea level prediction. the weighting function is calculated from the product of the parameter wgtfac default value = 0.50 and the half cosine function range = 0 to 1 used for nesting equation 1.8. the weighting of the station sea level prediction goes to zero at a defined distance from each station determined by the parameter zradius default value = 40 kin. the values of wgtfac and zradius can be changed in the parameter file assim.dat that resides in the work directory. changes to these parameters are not advised however unless there is a specific reason.\\npctides was developed to be used by metoc personnel who have some knowledge of oceanography. to apply pctides the user should know the latitude and longitude boundaries of their region of interest and the specific locations for which a forecast is required. the user first sets up a model \"domain\" by inputting the north/south limits of latitude and the east/west limits of longitude and the grid resolution the pc version also contains a gui based grid generator. this automatically generates the model grid and interpolates nrl dbdb2 bathymetry to that grid. next a user runs the program to interpolate the tidal boundary/initial conditions to the grid. all of this can be quickly plotted bathymetry tidal constituents etc. using the pc gui. this allows the user to take a first look at the area of interest. the user inputs a series of parameters defining the forecast attributes such as start time and length of the forecast data assimilation option on or off wind forcing and the required frequency of the model tidal output. in addition the user identifies the specific stations at which a forecast field is needed by inputting the latitude and longitude of that station. the user then executes the model.\\nthe pc version of this code includes a graphic capability to generate \".gif\\' plots of the forecast tidal time series. along with tidal height forecasts pctides provides forecasts of 2-d barotropic tidal currents. a graphic capability to generate \".gif\\' plots of the forecast tidal speed and direction is also included with the pc version. the user should take caution in utilizing the current information since it is not the full 3-d baroclinic ocean currents. the unix version of the code has no output graphic package. figure 2  b unix and pc grid generation software input latitude/longitude limits of the grid domain and resolution c adding the latest version of nrl dbdb2 bathymetry d modifying the bathymetry interpolation algorithm unix and pc versions now are identical e increasing the maximum array size f adding software to automatically move specified output stations that are on land due to numerical model grid resolution to the closest ocean grid point g modifying the frequency of field output h increasing bottom friction for high resolution nests i adding code to incorporate new high resolution bathymetric data j adding error messages to parts of the code to make it more user friendly and k modifying the documentation to reflect these changes. as such these changes were substantial enough to warrant withdrawing pctides 1.0 from oaml and delivering the new pctides 2.0 in its place.\\none of the revisions of the pctides upgrade included the improvement to the global boundary conditions from the finite element solution fes model. the major difference between the fes95 and fes99 is the resolution of the data. also the accuracy of the fes99 solutions was improved by assimilating tide gauge and topex/poseidon altimeter information. the data used in pctides 1.0 was fes 95 with a resolution of 0.5 degree. it contained both amplitude and phases of nine major tidal components. pctides 2.0 was upgraded to use the fes99 data. this dataset has 0.25 degree resolution and assimilates 687 topex/poseidon altimetry crossover data along with -700 tide gauge data in the database. it contains both amplitude and phases for the nine major tidal components and is a significant improvement both in the deep ocean and along the coasts.\\nglobally the maximum m2 the major constituent of the nine used in the model phase differences figure 2a are very small but with most differences occurring in the bering strait hudson bay and gulf of lawrence figure 2b in the western antarctic figure 2c and around australia and the indonesia coast figure 2d. the other limited areas where differences occur include the southeast mediterranean the iceland area and the kara and laptev sea. neither fes95 nor fes99 have values in the black or caspian seas. the amplitude differences are very small in most areas. \\na majority of the pctides evaluations were performed using pctides 1.0. however those specific evaluations were only minimally if at all affected by the modifications included in pctides version 2.0 and as such are believed to still be valid. if anything errors should be reduced.\\nthe pctides optest evaluation was performed by the regional centers at norfolk nlmoc and san diego npmoc. nlmoc chose the chesapeake bay as their evaluation location while npmoc chose three regions for evaluation: 1 scripps located off the southern california coast 2 an area near puget sound and 3 near the gulf of alaska. the pass/fail criteria determined prior to the optest by the centers were an rms error of less than 1.2 ft 0.365 m in amplitude and a phase error less than 45 minutes. pctides successfully passed this optest in each area studied as documented in the optest report appendix c and the preller et al. 2002 appendix d.\\nin addition to the optest pctides was run for the region encompassing the southwestern coast of spain. these runs were initially performed by nrl as part of a rapid response rr98 exercise off the spainist coast in 1998 using pctides 1.0 system. figure 3 shows the model domain used and the specified output stations.\\nfigure 3. model domain with bathymetry contours and station locations for the southwestern coast of spain.\\nthe model simulations were run without iho data assimilation and compared to the closest iho data point for evaluation. figures 4-6 show the comparisons of a 5-day 120 hour elevation forecast from pctides to the closest iho point at stations 1 3 and 6 6 being closest to the navy\\'s regional center at rota nemoc although the main focus of these evaluations has been on tidal elevation pctides also predicts 2-d barotropic tidal currents. a major obstacle in evaluating the pctide tidal currents is the lack of observations to compare against the model results. however an excellent opportunity to validate the models forecast velocities was presented to us when the naval oceanographic office provided us the data from four bottom mounted acoustic doppler current profilers adcp in the yellow sea deployed during the month of september 1995 figure 7 . this thirty-day time series of velocity data was compared to a pctides model forecast which assimilated iho data but had no wind or pressure forcing. the pctides forecasts of the tidal currents agree remarkably well with the depth-averaged adcp observations. the last five days are shown figure 8 . comparisons of the tidal heights for the entire time show the accuracy of pctides forecast capability figure 9  as compared to the water level elevations derived from pressure gauges on the adcp. \\na statistical evaluation of the pctide tidal elevation and phase along with tidal magnitude were compared to the adcp observations. the adcp observations were not assimilated into the pctides forecast but used only for validation. the statistics shown are the mean error me absolute mean error ame root mean square difference rmsd standard deviation sd the correlation coefficient r and the skill score ss.\\nthe statistics are computed from the following equations:\\nwhere me is the bias or annual mean difference x is mean of the data values y is the mean of the model values sd is the standard deviation and ox and 5y are the standard deviation of the data and model values respectively. for the mean difference me the smaller the number the smaller the difference between the model and the data. however if the mean is near zero as one would expect for a tidal time series then the mean error is not a good statistical tool to use. the lower the absolute mean difference ame the smaller the variability between the observation and the model. this value expresses the mean difference between the model and the observations. the root mean square rms difference reflects the variability between the observation and the data. this is the classic expression of how close the model solution is to the observations. the larger the variability between the observations the larger the rms error. like the rms the standard deviation sd gives you the variability of the data from the mean. as sd and rms increase the larger the variability of the data from the mean. a skill score ss of 1.0 indicates a perfect model prediction. a negative skill score indicates that the model may have normalized amplitudes larger than the correlation or large biases in the mean murphy and epstein 1989 .\\n19 table 1 shows the tidal elevation statistics for the mean of both the model with and without data assimilation and the observations the standard deviation of

results using data assimilation compared better to the actual observations than the pctides results without data assimilation values in parenthesis. the rms difference reflects the variability between the observations and the pctides model. in this test study area using the rms differences as our guide the pctides with assimilation varied slightly less from the observations by 30-50 cm than the pctides without assimilation which varied 31-53 cm. comparing the correlation coefficients the pctides with assimilation ranged between 0.70 and 0.89 compared best to observations than the pctides without assimilation that ranged between 0.72 and 0.81. a correlation coefficient of 1.0 indicates a perfect comparison.\\n20 table 2 shows the absolute mean error ame root mean squared rms and the

program. a pctides domain was set up for this region and run for the period may 1-june 11 1999. pctides forecast tidal currents were compared to tidal current measurements from the adcps. figure 11 shows examples from six stations at opposite ends of each line. pctides consistently under predicted the magnitude of the currents located at stations li-l5 anywhere from 1-23% 0.2 to 3.3 cm/sec and over predicted the magnitude of the currents located at stations l6-l1 1 anywhere from 5-27% 0.6 to 3.5 cm. current direction compared reasonably well at all stations.\\n124\\'e 125*e 126*e 127°e

beaufort nc chesapeake va and baltimore md which remained uninterrupted throughout the storm.\\nthese results indicated that given the correct path and hurricane definition 100 km rmw pctides did a very good job of predicting storm surge with an rms height error of 38 cm and an rms phase error of 50 minutes. note that pctides driven by coamps also did a reasonable job of predicting the phase and amplitude of the surge. also interesting is the fact that the predicted path provided by the hurricane center approximately 24-hours before landfall was approximately 100 km east of the actual track. this study showed that pctides could do an accurate job of predicting storm surge and that a useful application of pctides prior to landfall should include an ensemble of forecasts indicating the range of surge possible for coastal regions.\\npctides was used in the maritime rapid environmental assessment trial mrea04 which took place off the coast of portugal from march through april 2004 figure 14 . during this time pctides was run using real-time coamps wind and surface pressure fields to produce a 48-hour tidal elevation forecast. this forecast was used as input for two wave models also run during the exercise: 1 the nrl swan wave model included in the diops system and 2 the delft3d model. figure 15 shows a comparison of tidal elevation from the pctides forecast and observations

acquired from the \"aqs -20\" mine hunting sonar. this sonar is used to detect classify and identify moored and bottom mines using side-scan forward-looking and volume search sonar from deep to very shallow water. the accuracy of the environmental data collected can be affected by tides in the geographic area of interest. local tide variations can be provided by the pctides system for adjusting this bathymetric data. this work was presented at the spie security and defense symposium by costin barbu and will avera barbu et al. 2005. this corrected bathymetry could provide a useful tool for mine warefare operations.\\nthe pctides system developed by the naval research laboratory has been evaluated in a number of different locations by a number of different users. consensus from these users is that pctides is a useful and acceptably accurate tool for the prediction of tidal heights and wind driven surge. pctides 2.0 recently submitted to oaml is an improvement over the previous version in a number of ways including improved databases user-friendly software and a unix-based code. a pctides has the potential to be an excellent tidal modeling system.\\nthe flexibility of creating user-defined tidal stations and defining detailed model parameters greatly enhances our ability to support operational customers.\\nb although atmospheric forcing is integrated into pctides nemoc does not typically use this capability as most requests for tidal data are beyond the prognostic time scale for numerical models.\\nc an assessment of model accuracy was conducted for the rota spain local area. the evaluation consisted of designing a 10-km pctides grid and comparing model output with historical data \"hindcast\" and current observations \"forecast\".\\nour findings were that the model performs hindcasts and forecasts extremely well for the local area. the nw european shelf is an ideal region to assess the performance of a re-locatable tidesurge modelling system for several reasons: it is a data-rich area with more than 30 tide gauges located around the uk coast the coast itself is varied with several estuaries interconnected by open coastal sections the dynamics of the tides and storm surges differ between the west coast of britain and the east coast at pol we have over 30 years experience of modelling and forecasting tides and surges around the uk coast.\\nour evaluation took the form of a designing a pctides grid compatible with our own model grid approximately 12km resolution and comparing i tides and ii surges during april & may 2001 both with and without pctides assimilation of tidal constants and b designing and implementing higher resolution pctides grids in specific areas of interest for either tidal characteristics bristol channel has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world or surge characteristics liverpool bay -direct surge forcing southern north sea -external surge forcing.\\nthe overall findings were as follows:\\n\"* tides in pctides on the 12km grid without data assimilation were less accurate than the tuned tides of the pol model \"• tides in pctides on the 12km grid with data assimilation were of similar accuracy to the tuned tides of the pol model \"• surges in pctides on the 12km grid with data assimilation were of similar accuracy to those of the pol model only along open coasts in the estuaries they were significantly worse \"* surges in pctides on the higher resolution grids with data assimilation were of similar accuracy to those of the pol model\\nthe evaluation has shown that pctides can produce tides and storm surges of comparable quality to those provided by a specifically tuned system. the initial \\'first guess\\' pctides could produce equivalent results only on open coasts requiring data assimilation of tidal constants to improve on the tidal response in estuarine waters. a noticeable fact was the role the data assimilation played: the data-rich uk coast sometimes over-specified the assimilation requiring careful consideration when having tide gauge locations in a coarse 12km adjacent model grid cells. it also showed the value of the data assimilation as without it the results were not as good as in the pol model. higher resolution models could produce better tide and surge results.\\ni was impressed with the capability of pctides. initial results were obtained within hours of setting up the system and comparable results to a system established over 20 years and continuously monitored obtained within days. the ease with which higher resolution models could be set up made exploring optimum grid resolutions a simple task and demonstrated how these could improve results. the role of available tidal data should not be underestimated however the data-rich nw shelf enabled pctides to perform well in this area.\\nif you require further details i would be pleased to discuss the results of my evaluation with you at greater length.\\nroger proctor\\nappendix c pctides optest report\\nthis report summarizes the pctides operational evaluation plan implementation of that plan and the results. to maximize relevance to current operations the evaluation was designed and implemented at nlmoc and npmoc san diego over 3 months for 12 different stations. in summary the report recommends that the basic model should be included in oaml and is suitable for fleet use after certain modifications and with caveats for operational use. we recommend the modified version of pctides be included into the nites software suite and on in the met team laptops. the modifications recommended include changes in user interface product output and display. the caveats recommended are caution in interpretation of model outputs when run near river outflows and for large semi-enclosed bays and estuaries where wind direction seriously affects tidal response. guidance for these interpretations should be included in the operations manual.\\nthe optest was conducted both at nlmoc norfolk and npmoc san diego between 1 march to 31 june 2001. the model was run by the center\\'s operational watch once a day for 90 days making forecasts 12 24 and 48 hours ahead using in parallel coamps and nogaps windfield forcing at 12-hour intervals throughout the forecast period.\\nthe numerous widely separated stations tested the model\\'s ability to forecast tidal heights at any required location a major improvement over gfmpl. the test area\\'s tidal station locations were inserted into pctides as forecast points. the noaa tidal station data were qc\\'d at noaa and joined with the forecast water levels for statistical analysis. the primary parameters used are \"* amd meters: absolute mean difference between forecast and observed water levels \"• phase minutes: mean phase difference between forecast and observed times of high and low water.\\nabsolute values were not used so that the +/-\"lag\" effect could be observed. + indicates model lag. \"* rmse meters: root mean square error of forecast water levels from observed. \"* rmsph minutes: root mean square error of the forecast phase from the observed phase.\\nsince pctides current predictions are for barotropic conditions only current predictions were not validated. it is recommended this output be eliminated because the operator could be misled if such values were relied upon in the common baroclinic situation.\\nthe pass/fail criteria were selected so as to be a significant improvement over the information presently available to the naval operator.\\n1_ the root mean square percent error of pctides predicted water relative to mean sea level msl vs. noaa observed water levels relative to msl must be less than 1.2 foot 0.365 meters.\\n2. the root mean square percent error of pctides predicted water levels max/min times vs. noaa observed water level max/min times must be less than 45 minutes.\\noverall the forecasts exceeding the threshold can be explained as follows:\\nbaltimore and solomon island: as harbors sitting at the end of a long se fetch an unusual sensitivity to forecast wind direction is evident in the data. since this geographical situation is not uncommon a caveat is indicated warning the user to interpret the pctides forecast in light of this local sensitivity to wind direction.\\nwindmill point: tidal measurement station is located inside a river mouth. since pctides does not include river outflow the forecasts would have the added error during rain events although the following stations passed the criteria the optest revealed other errors and sensitivities. at kodiak alaska the station location was incorrectly inserted into pctides causing the forecast to be made for a location in 85 m. 285 ft. of water. at the southern california station_phase error was shown as a partial function of the grid scale chosen. for this station nrl suggested a grid resolution below 10 km. however the operator chose 17 km. and produced a phase error of 24 minutes. later runs at 5 km. grid showed a 5 minute phase error. this phase error source was also a factor at kodiak alaska. therefore a caveat should be included warning the user to use a grid resolution <10 km.\\nthe optest also revealed problems with the user interface product dissemination and identification of area of interest. though feedback from various users at both npmoc and nlmoc potential improvements were noted and are listed in the recommendation section below. since pctides code was written to run both on dos and unix we suggest that flexibility be retained and the existing user interface modified accordingly.\\nthis panel finds the relocatability of pctides is a significant improvement over gfmpl. pctides eliminates the need for the operator to estimate what the water height at anchorage will be some lateral distance from the gfmpl data station location a considerable source of error. while we have concerns regarding sensitivity of wind direction this can 38 be addressed by a caveat. the user interface should be improved for inclusion in the nites software suite before pctides becomes operational.\\nwe therefore recommend that pctides is suitable for fleet use and inclusion in the nites software suite only after the following improvements have been made.\\ninstallation: the program must be configured such that installation from a cd or diskette by an untrained user is simple and effective.\\nuser interface:\\na. the dos windows functions should be incorporated into the existing code for windows and formatted for inclusion in the nites software suite. b. the batch files of the wind forcing be a default chosen initially by the user so as to retain the options of choosing a selected model or point source winds and to minimize the keystrokes required to run the model c. graphics should be modernized. the displayed coastlines should represent the chosen grid resolutions. during setup the program should allow insertion of wind file location in the local lan. this should be a default so the user need not re-enter it each run. d. the source of the wind forcing used should be on the screen and saved in the product files. e. defining a grid should be made similar to metcast client. the user should be able to rubber band an forecast area and identify the tidal stations by enter lat/lon. the program should invisibly call the appropriate tidal data bathymetry and wind field. f. grid resolutions should be in kilometers. g. a pop-up window warning should be included that tells the user the depths of all chosen stations and when any selected point is on land or has a depth beyond a practical threshold level. products:\\na. output of prediction curves should be user choice formats tif gif etc compatible with jmv. b. an option for automatically emailing the output to a user-defined list of addresses should be included.. c. display of barotropic currents should be eliminated to avoid operational use in baroclinic waters. d. auto-insertion into designated web pages should be built in for use at navy centers. the web addresses and other info can be inserted first time by the user caveats: a. the user should be warned against using the model in or near river mouths. guidance should be given on the best interpretation of model output. b. if the forecast position is inside semi-enclosed waters the user should be warned about forecast sensitivity to winds in directions parallel to the bay\\'s major axis. some guidance for this interpretation should be written and included to help the user estimate the phase and amplitude depending on wind vector forecasts. c. a general guide of accuracy in water height and timing based on opeval data should be included.\\nif the above modifications are made satisfactorily this committee will approve pctides for operational use. . available and/or astronomical forcing. the global ocean bathymetry is a 2-minute global database developed by the naval research laboratory. atmospheric forcing from the navy\\'s global or regional models is provided through the t system metcast system and used to generate real time wind he pctides driven forecasts. pctides output includes time series of tidal height deviations at each grid point of the model and time series of tidal height deviations at higher frequency usually 10-12 minutes at specified point locations. barotropic tidal currents are also produced by the system.

and robust communications. the alaska ocean observing system partners with government agencies universities tribes and industry to evaluate innovative observing technologies infrastructure and applications that address these challenges. these approaches support acquisition of ocean observing data necessary for forecasting and reporting conditions for safe navigation and response to emergencies and coastal hazards. three applications are now delivering real-time surface current sea ice and water level data in areas not possible a mere 10 years ago. one particular challenge in alaska is providing robust alternative power solutions for shore-based observing. remote power options have been evolving alongside resilient technologies and are being designed for freeze-up conditions making it possible to keep remotely deployed operational systems running and easy to maintain year-round. in this paper three remote observing approaches are reviewed including use of off-grid power to operate high-frequency hf radars for measuring surface currents a real-time ice detection buoy that remains deployed throughout the freeze-up cycle and a high-quality water level observing alternative to noaa's national water level observing network nwlon installations. these efforts are highly collaborative and require working partnerships and combined funding from other

background: elevated serum prostate-specific antigen psa levels are predictive of a future diagnosis of prostate cancer. to test the hypothesis that older men with low psa levels may require less

cohort study among participants in a study of aging who had serial psa measurements taken from age 60 or 65 years until they either were diagnosed with prostate cancer cancer case subjects or reached the age of 75 years subjects without prostate cancer. the time of cancer detection among cancer case subjects was defined as the measurement date on which a psa level above 4.0 ng/ml was detected i.e. psa conversion. cancer case subjects and subjects without prostate cancer were analyzed according to baseline psa level and age. results: all cancer case subjects in the 60-year-old cohort had

from cross-sectional studies can be the result of differential secular influences among the age cohorts. to determine the magnitude of height loss that accompanies aging longitudinal studies are required. the authors studied 2084 men and women aged 17-94 years enrolled from 1958 to 1993 in the baltimore longitudinal study of aging baltimore maryland. on average men\\'s height was measured nine times during 15 years and women\\'s height five times during 9 years. the rate of decrease in height was greater for women than for men. for both sexes height loss began at about age 30 years and accelerated with increasing age. cumulative height loss from age 30 to 70 years averaged about 3 cm for men and 5 cm for women by age 80 years it increased to 5 cm for men and 8 cm for women. this degree of height loss would account for an \"artifactual\" increase in body mass index of approximately 0.7 kg/m 2 for men and 1.6 kg/m 2 for women by age 70 years that increases to 1.4 and 2.6 kg/m 2  respectively by age 80 years. true height loss with aging must be taken into account when height or indexes based on height is used in physiologic or clinical studies. am j epidemiol 1999 150:969-77.

height have been reported. for example in 1950 biichi 1 catalogued some 50 reports published between 1829 and 1947. while a number of studies have described the longitudinal rate of loss of height with aging 2 only seven covered the entire adult life span and in only three of these were there more than two height measurements per subject. a collation of 17 studies on longitudinal change in height with aging will be reported separately 2.\\nany age-related change in height has implications beyond descriptive anthropometry. if height changes with age indexes of obesity such as the body mass index bmi weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared would change with age independent of any change in obesity. because bmi is related to the square of the height even a small change in height may have a large effect on the bmi. thus a given bmi could have different meanings for adults at different ages even if no other changes in body composition occurred with aging. because height is lost with normal aging it is important to quantify the effect the height \"artifact\" has on the computed bmi. recent proposals of best weight for height suggest that a modest increase in bmi with age is related to optimum survival 34. it is possible that the suggested magnitude of the bmi increase is no more than a result of the height artifact on bmi. to ascertain whether bmi should increase beyond the magnitude of the effect due to the age-related height artifact the magnitude of the artifact must be determined.\\nto ascertain the pattern of adult height change as a function of age to compare the patterns for men and women and to examine the effect of height change with age on bmi we analyzed data from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa baltimore

of different scenarios and the strategies and policies that can lead to the optimum handling of people movement during emergency events. however if we are to model human travel behavior effectively the first requirement is good data on human response to emergencies and the factors that influence their response. in the past most data collected on emergency events has been collected to observe the behaviour and attitudes of people exposed to these conditions and relatively little attention has been given to identify the factors that influence these decisions so that a modeling capability can be developed. since developing a modeling capability of travel during emergencies is so important to achieve the maximum safety of the population this paper is aimed at encouraging the travel survey

framework. the principal innovation behind mkl is that it learns an optimal combination of kernel similarity matrices while simultaneously training a classifier. in classification experiments mkl outperformed an svm trained on all available features by 3%-4%. we are especially interested in whether such markers are capable of identifying early signs of the disease. to address this question we have examined whether our multi-modal disease marker mmdm can predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment mci to ad. our experiments reveal that this measure shows significant group differences between mci subjects who progressed to ad and those who remained stable for 3 years. these differences were most significant in mmdms based on imaging data. we also discuss the relationship between our mmdm and an individual's conversion from mci to ad.\", 'c713a2ef-ffaf-4164-a7c8-97c4c80b7c50': \" many undergraduates fail to complete a degree a matter of considerable concern to both policymakers and scholars berkner cuccaro-alamin & mccormick 1996 berkner he & cataldi 2002 brainard & fuller 2010 carroll 1989 horn 1996 horn & berger 2004 . one influential perspective explaining degree noncompletion emphasizes the notion of academic momentum adelman 1999 adelman  2006 . this perspective advances three core ideas. the first is that an undergraduate's initial academic course load and progress set a trajectory that strongly influences subsequent degree completion. in particular an early loss of momentum greatly reduces a student's chances of graduation. second this early momentum is associated with degree attainment over and above the effects of a student's sociodemograpmc background and high school academic preparation it has an influence of its own. third the theory suggests that certain components of academic momentum such as enrolling in summer courses may provide practical interventions for improving completion rates.\\nthe momentum perspective offers important insights with implications for policy however there are conceptual as well as methodological problems with some momentum ideas and analyses. in this article we modify and narrow the approach to avoid potential problems of selection bias and causal circularity and we test the empirical validity of the modified theory using college transcript data from a nationally representative sample of eighth graders who were tracked into college and beyond. we use alternative techniques to estimate effect sizes for four components of momentum and we also examine whether these elements have a larger effect for some subgroups of undergraduates than for others effect heterogeneity. we find empirical support for several but not all of the core ideas and we discuss implications from our findings for

rate. even when the percentage of single-father families increases as a portion of all families as it has done part of that increase is because the pool of family households has decreased as a portion of all households. that is in 1960 family households represented about 85% of all us households today they represent about 66% because nonfamily households single persons and cohabitors without children have increased us census 2013b . therefore the rate of one-parent father households has increased about fourfold since 1960 us census 2013c . however the percentage of children being raised in those households has increased at a slower rate.\\nanother way to measure single fatherhood is according to the percentage of children living with their father only which is longerterm data from the us census bureau. that data indicate that the proportion of children living with fathers increased nearly threefold since the 1960s from 1.3% in 1960 to 3.7% in 2009 but the period 1950-1980 was a historic low in father-only parenting. in 1880 2.6% of children under 18 were living in father-only families and in 1920 2.9% were us census 2011  making the long-term increase less than twofold.\\nanother measurement issue that may contribute to an inflated increase in single fathers is that the census definition of father-only families includes fathers who cohabit with romantic partners. as table  1 shows about 22% of children living in father-only households are living with cohabiting fathers. this does not include single fathers who are cohabiting with the biological mothers those households are included under two-parent households. including cohabiting single fathers likely increases the number and percentage of men included as father-only families. no matter what the exact increase is several legal and cultural factors have played a role in producing it. the concept of fatherhood has changed so that more \"parenting\" not only the provision of income is expected of fathers taylor parker morin cohn & wang 2013 . laws governing divorce and custody have changed in ways designed to treat spouses and parents more equally and they have thus facilitated more father custody although several studies indicate that most single fathers obtain custody through out-of-court agreements between parents coles 2009 hamer & marchioro 2002 pearson munson & thoennes 1982 . single men are now allowed to adopt children usually older children but these adoptions whether by gay or straight men account for a very small percentage of single fathers. adoption statistics are hard to come by because states are not required to keep record of them. however it is estimated that in recent years about 3% of adoptions through foster care have been by single men often gay and adoptions by single men through foster care are usually of older harder-to-place children koch 2007 . in 2007 the williams institute estimated that about 65000 adopted children were being raised in lgbt homes but many of these are households headed by lesbian women gates badgett macomber & chambers 2007 .\\nthe most significant contributing factors have been demographic in nature. until the 1980s divorce and secondarily widowhood largely accounted for single fatherhood. divorce has since declined from its 1980 peak but it has leveled off at a relatively high rate and thus remains a primary contributing factor. in 1980 the proportion of widowed single fathers was surpassed by never-married single fathers. nonmarital births accounted for about 41% of all births in 2011 child trends databank 2013 . this trend intersects with the growing popularity of cohabitation as the majority of nonmarital births occur with cohabitation child trends databank 2013 . thus a much greater percentage of single fathers attain their role following nonmarital births whether or not they cohabit. as table 1 shows according to 2013 census data children in never-married fatherhouseholds are now the second-largest group of children 30.6% in father-only households and widowed 4.4% households are the smallest group.\\nresearch on single fathers has mirrored the increase in single fathering evolving over the years in quantity and quality. this article reviews the research on single fathers and their families from the 1970s focusing on changes in methodology and theoretical underpinnings over the years. the article also summarizes the main findings on what we know about single fathers and it concludes with directions for future theorizing research and practice.\\nit is important to note here that the terms designating single fathers vary so who qualifies as a single father may vary from one study to the next. the census bureau uses the terms father-only households or male-headed households with own children. as mentioned earlier these labels include men who cohabit with someone other than the child\\'s mother 22.4% cohabit with other relatives 21.3% or are currently married but are separated 16.7% or the spouse is absent for some reason 4.5% see table 1 . in the pew report mentioned earlier livingston 2013  single fathers included unmarried men who reported that their children had been living with them for at least two months and 41% of the fathers were cohabiting. it is unclear in the report what percentage if any of cohabiting partners were the biological mother.\\nsome researchers study \"custodial fathers\" which often means divorced fathers who have custody of children and some of those fathers may be remarried. for instance in grall\\'s 2011 study of custodial parents\\' receipt of child support which relied on census data about 22% of custodial fathers were married compared to 18% of custodial mothers. however most of the time custodial just means the father has custody legal or otherwise of one or more of his children. occasionally single father is used to refer to nonresident fathers although i excluded such studies from this review. throughout this review i have used single fathers generally to refer to men cohabiting or not who are coresiding with their children separately from the child\\'s mother. but when discussing specific research i have tried to employ the terms used by the researchers.\\nsome claim that fathers who cohabit or live with extended family are not truly single fathers as if they were cheating some idealized type of single fatherhood but they are legally single and single mothers are measured in the same way although usually a smaller percentage of them are cohabiting and a higher percentage lives with extended family see table 1 . it remains to each specific study to determine the extent to which the fathers are coparenting with their new spouses or cohabiting partners or other adults and the extent to which coparenting is beneficial to the fathers and the children some research seems to indicate that it is not that beneficial. in addition keep in mind that even fathers residing alone with their children are often coparenting with nonresident mothers or other helpful adults. let\\'s also keep in mind that single mothers who are also coparenting or getting help from other adults don\\'t usually have their \"single parent\" status questioned. finally it is often integral to the research question to include single and custodial fathers who are married or cohabiting. grall\\'s 2011 study needed to compare the effect of marriage on receipt of child support other studies have aimed to detect the effects of the presence of other adults on single fathers and their children. most research to date particularly quantitative data sets for which data are originally collected with some other purpose in mind has not found a way to fully capture all these possible scenarios and their repercussions simultaneously. hence it is up to researchers to be aware of and weed out various father categories according to the needs of the research question and to clarify differences among fathers\\' residences in their conclusions. it is readers\\' responsibility to discern how the research defines and counts \"single father.\"\\nthe articles included in this review were obtained by searching for the keywords single father in social science databases such as jstor and academic elite. a few secondary articles were added if they were repeatedly cited in the first-level articles. a few of those secondary articles actually stemmed from research focusing on \"family structure\" but they included a sample of single fathers. for a

the first set of globally accepted criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ad was only established in 1984 by the national institute of neurological and communicative disorders and stroke and the alzheimer's disease and related disorders association nincds-adrda [2] . prior to these criteria a suspected clinical diagnosis of ad could only be confirmed with certainty by the post mortem observation of 'senile plaques' and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain much as they were described to appear by alois alzheimer himself as he visualized them with low power microscopy using bielschowsky silver stain [1] . while diagnosis in living patients represents a significant advance when applied by expert clinicians the 1984 clinical criteria are reported to have only approximately 80% positive predictive value ppv and 60% negative predictive value npv for a pathology-confirmed diagnosis [3] . in general by clinical criteria sensitivity proportion of true positive results increases with more permissive clinical criteria and specificity proportion of true negative results increases with more restrictive clinical criteria. however the opposite is true for neuropathologic criteria.\\nappropriately a proposal to develop and validate new biomarkers for ad was included in the 2011 national institute on aging-alzheimer's association nia-aa updated diagnostic recommendations [4] [5] [6] [7] . underpinning the 2011 recommendations is the recognition that the progression of ad biomarkers over time likely follows an ordered temporal sequence and the aβ biomarkers e.g. low brain aβ clearance i.e. low cerebrospinal fluid [csf] aβ 42  and tracer retention on amyloid positron emission tomography [pet] imaging are representative of upstream events [5] .\\nwhile normally csf flows out of the brain ventricles idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus inph may be caused by csf 'backflow' into the brain from the ventricles [8] . studies of various analytes have shown that a concentration gradient exists between csf taken from the ventricles higher concentration and csf taken from the lumbar spine lower concentration [9] [10] [11] [12] . aβ oligomers self-assemble into the larger aβ species [13]  which are deposited as plaque in the brain elevated soluble aβ oligomers in csf have been associated with ad although the data are inconsistent and the culprit toxic oligomer still needs to be identified [14] . with a hypothetical leap it may not be so surprising that ad-like aβ pathology frequently occurs concomitantly with inph.\\nclinically patients with inph present with a classic triad of symptoms: cognitive impairment gait abnormalities and urinary incontinence. untreated inph is progressive [15] . the treatment for inph is surgical placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. a small cortical biopsy from the site of shunt placement may be obtained during the procedure. though inph itself may cause dementia an identifiable neurodegenerative process often underlies the cognitive decline [16] . concomitant ad pathology is not uncommon [17] [18] [19]  up to 68% in one series [20]  and may be associated with a poorer response to ventriculoperitoneal shunting [17 18] . biopsies from inph patients represent a unique opportunity to study correlations between pet amyloid imaging and pathology in living subjects.\\nthe pet radioligand pittsburgh compound b pib which is a neutral analog of thioflavin t a stain which detects fibrillar amyloid has been extensively studied both in living subjects and in autopsy tissue. pib was designed to cross the blood-brain barrier bind with high selectivity and nanomolar affinity to fibrillar aβ and clear rapidly from the brain [21] . cortical [ 11 c]pib uptake as measured by pet in living subjects correlates with fibrillar aβ load measured subsequently by immunohistochemical stains for aβ 40 and aβ 42 post mortem [22] [23] [24] . unfortunately the short half-life of [ 11 c] about 20 minutes requires an on-site cyclotron for its production limiting its use to academic medical and specialized imaging centers. conse [27] . in this analysis we used [ 18

separately as [20 [29] [30] [31]  respectively were undertaken in inph patients requiring surgical shunt procedures or intracranial pressure icp monitoring to determine how well cerebral fibrillar aβ uptake of [ 18 f]flutemetamol as quantified by pet imaging corresponded with immunohistochemical ihc and histochemical hc estimates of amyloid burden in biopsy samples taken during these procedures. two of the studies one in europe and one in the united states [us] were retrospective studies in which the biopsy was followed by the pet scan. two of the studies one in the europe and one in the us were prospective studies in which the order of procedures was reversed.\\n[\\n18 f]flutemetamol uptake was measured quantitatively in specific brain regions including the cortical area of prospective studies or surrounding retrospective studies the biopsy site ipsilateral site and the site in the contralateral hemisphere that corresponded to the biopsy site contralateral site. a composite neocortical measure of [ 18 f]flutemetamol uptake was also calculated by averaging the uptake from frontal cortex anterior cingulate gyrus posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus lateral-temporal cortex and parietal cortex. aβ plaque frequency was determined and scored in biopsy specimens stained with bielschowsky silver stain and thioflavin s. the percentage of grey-matter area occupied by plaque was also assessed following ihc for the monoclonal antibody 4g8. finally based on all available stains/slides an overall pathology assessment was rendered of the aβ load in biopsy tissue grey matter. these 4 pathology endpoints served as the standard of truth sot in comparisons with the [\\nin a pooled analysis of these 4 studies as previously reported for specific parameters [ [32] . this

women. j appl physiol 95: 1425-1430  2003 . first published june 13 2003 10.1152/japplphysiol.00516. 2003.-we performed gene screening of the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor cntfr gene and genotyped three newly identified polymorphisms: c-1703t in the 5ј promoter region t1069a in intron 5 and c174t in exon 9. we studied the association of these cntfr variants with muscle strength mass and body composition in 465 men and women 20-90 yr from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging. only the c174t variant was significantly associated with muscle-related phenotypes. in the entire cohort when corrected for age sex race physical activity and height homozygotes for the common c allele at c174t cc exhibited lower total body mass and body mass index than carriers of the rare t allele which appeared to be due to significant differences in total nonosseous fat-free mass ffm 48.0 ϯ 0.4 vs. 50.0 ϯ 0.7 kg p ϭ 0.011 and lower limb ffm 16.5 ϯ 0.1 vs. 17.2 ϯ 0.2 kg p ϭ 0.002. the cc group also exhibited significantly lower quadriceps concentric and eccentric isokinetic strength values at both 30 and 180°/s than the t allele carriers all p ͻ 0.04 but these differences were no longer significant after adjustment for lower limb ffm. there were no significant sex-by-genotype interactions. the results indicate that the c174t polymorphism in exon 9 of cntfr is significantly associated with ffm in men and women with concomitant differences in muscular strength. genetics muscle mass muscle strength polymorphism sex ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor although the specific mechanisms are unclear the etiology of sarcopenia appears to be multifactorial encompassing humoral neurogenic genetic and environmental factors 27 29 . genetic factors are known to contribute to a significant fraction of the variability in lean body mass and muscle strength 1 37 38 as well as grip strength in older adults 10 and the change in strength with age 2 but the identification of specific contributing genes is difficult. a primary strategy is the use of association studies to test genes with encoded proteins that have known physiological relevance to the proposed mechanisms of muscle wasting with the ultimate goal of reconciling the complex interplay of genetic and nongenetic factors.\\nciliary neurotrophic factor cntf and its receptor cntfr represent an important physiological pathway from which genetic studies can be initiated. in addition to an important role in motoneuron survival 24 cntf has direct muscle influences. for example cntf administration has been shown to increase muscle fiber number in developing rat muscle 25 stimulate myotube formation in regenerating mouse muscle 23 and slow atrophy of denervated 16 and unweighted 9 rat soleus muscle. moreover guillet et al. 14 showed that cntf administration to aged 24 mo rats improved soleus twitch and tetanic tensions to the level of adult 6 mo rats. a null mutation in the cntf gene has been identified and although it is not associated with neurological disease development 34 the null allele has been implicated as a modifier for the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 12 and multiple sclerosis 13. we have previously shown that men and women heterozygous for the null allele exhibited greater muscle strength than homozygotes for the common allele 28.\\ncntf can signal through a receptor complex comprised of a cntf-specific ␣-receptor subunit cntfr and two additional subunits gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor 4 5 30 . cntfr is expressed in skeletal muscle with expression being upregulated in response to muscle damage 19 and hindlimb unweighting 15 in rats and denervation in human skeletal muscle 44 . surprisingly mice lacking cntf are viable with no overt abnormalities yet mice lacking cntfr die perinatally although mice heterozygous for a cntfr null mutation appear normal and are fertile 6. the cntfr null mice exhibited significantly lower numbers of motoneurons in a number of motoneuron populations. cntfr also acts as a ligand for cardiotrophin-like cytokine clc which has been shown to support survival of motor and sympathetic neurons in vitro 31 although little else is known about its function. thus cntfr appears to act as a', 'ceb9581f-0cce-4735-9ffe-627b597ea400': 'abstract maximizing the flow of students through the science technology engineering and math stem pipeline is important to promoting human capital development and reducing economic inequality. a critical juncture in the stem pipeline is the highly cumulative sequence of secondary school math courses. students from disadvantaged schools are less likely to complete advanced math courses. here we conduct an analysis of how the math pipeline differs across schools using student polygenic scores which are dna-based indicators of propensity to succeed in education. we integrated genetic and official school transcript data from over 3000 european-ancestry students from u.s. high schools. we used polygenic scores as a molecular tracer to understand how the flow of students through the high school math pipeline differs in socioeconomically advantaged versus disadvantaged schools. students with higher education polygenic scores were tracked to more advanced math already at the beginning of high school and persisted in math for more years. analyses using genetics as a molecular tracer revealed that the dynamics of the math pipeline differed by school advantage. compared to disadvantaged schools advantaged schools buffered students with low polygenic scores from dropping out of math. across all schools even students with exceptional polygenic scores top 2% were unlikely to take the most advanced math classes suggesting substantial room for improvement in the development of potential stem talent. these results link new molecular genetic discoveries to a common target of educational-policy reforms.\\nnpj science of learning 2020 5:1

complex conundrum. [1][2][3][4][5][6] [7] stiffening of central arteries after the age of 40 years is a characteristic feature of life and is accompanied by an age-associated change in bp.\\n1 epidemiological studies demonstrate that increased aortic stiffness indexed as an increased pulse wave velocity pwv 8 9 is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events even when the impact of age bp and other known risk factors are taken into account. [10] [11] [12] these findings suggest that prevention or reduction of pwv may carry substantial health benefits. 13 cross-sectional studies show that bp is strongly associated with pwv. bp is transmitted into the arterial wall where its increase progressively stimulates the less distensible collagen fibers thus resulting in a progressively stiffer artery.\\n14 therefore the age-associated increase in arterial stiffness has long been considered to parallel the ageassociated increase in bp.\\n1 yet the rates at which pwv and bp accelerate within individuals who differ in age and sex is largely unknown but their definition is required to unravel the conundrum of interactions of arterial stiffness and bp as age increases and is also required for correct power analyses and the age/sex composition of clinical trials aiming to intervene on pwv. therefore an understanding of the age-bp-arterial stiffness conundrum is a major public health priority.\\nthe present study determined the evolution of bp and pwv trajectories in people of different ages by measuring both pwv and bp systolic bp [sbp] diastolic bp [dbp] mean bp [mbp] and pulse pressure [pp] trajectories during 9.4 years of follow-up in >4000 community-dwelling men and women of 20 to 100 years of age at entry into the study. we discovered that the association of bp and aortic pwv is much more complicated than appreciated previously possibly because of concurrent age- sex and pressure-dependent aortic remodeling.\\nsubjects and methods\\nthe sardinia study a joint study in sardinia of the national institute

abstract-the age-associated increase in arterial stiffness has long been considered to parallel or to cause the age-associated increase in blood pressure bp. yet the rates at which pulse wave velocity pwv a measure of arterial stiffness and bp trajectories change over time within individuals who differ by age and sex have not been assessed and compared. this study determined the evolution of bp and aortic pwv trajectories during a 9.4-year follow-up in >4000 communitydwelling men and women of 20 to 100 years of age at entry into the sardinia study. linear mixed effects model analyses revealed that pwv accelerates with time during the observation period at about the same rate over the entire age range in both men and women. in men the longitudinal rate at which bp changed over time however did not generally parallel that of pwv acceleration: at ages >40 years the rates of change in systolic bp sbp and pulse pressure pp increase plateaued and then declined so that sbp itself also declined at older ages whereas pp plateaued. in women sbp diastolic bp and mean bp increased at constant rates across all ages producing an increasing rate of increase in pp. therefore increased

in the present analyses is similar for men and women.\\nbp was measured in both arms with a mercury sphygmomanometer using an appropriately sized cuff. the bp values used in this study are the average

variables. all analyses were performed using sas for windows version 9.2 cary nc. data are presented as mean±sd unless otherwise specified. both cross-sectional and longitudinal changes were modeled with a single linear mixed-effects regression model 18 19 which easily accommodates unbalanced unequally spaced observations and consequently is an ideal tool for analyzing both cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in data from this observational study. additional details including a glossary of model terms and interpretations are in the online-only data supplement. the fit of the mixed-effects models to the data is addressed by plots of the residuals and plots of observed versus predicted values. these plots are presented in the online-only data supplement and show that the models provide adequate fits to the data.\\neach model-fit represents a specific hypothesis being tested and each model contains several model effects. in conducting the backward elimination variable selection procedure it is prudent to guard against false-positive results. to do so for each model fit a bonferroni-adjusted significance level is used: for the basic models that contain 5 model effects the adjusted significance level is 0.05/5=0.01 and for the models with additional covariates the full model contains 15 model effects so the adjusted significance level is 0.05/15=0.00333.\\nresults\\naverage age pwv pp sbp dbp mean bp heart rate body mass index and percentage of subjects in each sex are listed in table 1 . although there is no difference in the mean followup time between men and women participants p=0.3338 there is a significant difference in mean follow-up time by age decade p<0.0001.\\nto determine whether there are significant sex effects on pwv we first fit mixed-effects models 18 to lnpwv see statistical analysis section in the online-only data supplement for motivation of modeling the transformed pwv that included data on both men and women. there were significant sex differences in pwv measured both cross sectionally and longitudinally see the online-only data supplement. consequently we subsequently constructed separate models for men and women for lnpwv and for each of the bp variables. table 2 lists the estimates for the fitted models for pwv in men and women. the graphs in figure 1a and 1b are generated from the equations provided by the mixed-effects models in table 2 . the pwv model formula for men is provided in the legend of figure 1 . the cross-sectional association of pwv with age at entry is represented by the left or beginning point of each line segment. the average longitudinal rates of change of pwv for subjects of different entry ages are illustrated by the slopes of the 5-year line segments in the plot. also included on the plots are 95% confidence bands for each line segment. thus the plots in figure 1a and 1b show how pwv changes with entry age among different subjects and the pattern and the magnitude of the increase in the rate of change of pwv over time varied by entry age and sex. in both men and women the average rate of change in pwv increased by ≈60% from entry age of 30 years to entry age of 70 years  figure 1c .\\nsex-specific longitudinal pwv trajectories by entry age\\nas expected the use of antihypertensive medications increased with advancing age with no sex differences p=0.22 table  s5 . to disentangle the possible effect of antihypertensive medications on the longitudinal changes in pwv we constructed additional models. it was found that antihypertensive medications did not significantly affect the cross-sectional or longitudinal conclusions for pwv. thus trends described in pwv tables 2-4 figure 1  are independent of use of antihypertensive medications that as expected is greater at older ages. additional specific details are discussed in the online-only data supplement effects of antihypertensive medications on pwv trajectories. tables 3 and 4 list the model effects for sbp and figure 2c and 2d illustrate the models. cross-sectional bp ie at entry age differences are similar to those described in the literature. the average longitudinal rates of change in sbp vary in a nonlinear fashion. in men the average longitudinal rate of change of sbp increases with age at entry until 40 years beyond which the rate of increase declines figures 3 and 4 . note that beyond entry age of 50 years the average longitudinal rate of change in sbp becomes negative the rate of change in sbp crosses the zero axis and sbp itself begins to decline. thus although when measured cross sectionally in different men of different ages sbp increases with age longitudinal analyses in the same men over time indicate that the maximum average rate at which sbp increases is achieved by the entry age of 40 years and that beyond entry age of 50 years the average rate of change becomes negative and on average sbp declines. in women the rate of increase in sbp remains constant and positive at all ages studied figures 3 and 4 . tables 3 and 4 provide the parameter estimates for the various terms in the model for dbp for men and women. the models show that the average rate of dbp change in men exhibits a monotonic decline between entry ages 30 and 70 years becoming negative at the age of 50 years. in contrast to men in women the average longitudinal change in dbp is positive and constant at all entry ages figures 3 and 4 . tables 3 and 4 provide the parameter estimates for pp and figure 2a and 2b illustrate the fitted models. figures 2a 3 and 4 show that in men the average longitudinal rate of pp increase plateaus at the entry age of 55 years and the rate of pp increase declines thereafter until entry age 70 years when there is little change in pp. in women in contrast to men the average longitudinal rate of change of pp dictated by rates of change in sbp and dbp increases monotonically with every decade after the entry age of 30 years figures 3 and 4b . table s7 and figure s5 present the mbp analyses. the average longitudinal rates of change in mbp are illustrated in figures 3 and 4 . in men mbp increases up through the age of ≈50 years changing to declines at older ages. in women the average rate of mbp increases at a constant rate at all entry ages figures 3 and 4b .\\nbp trajectories over

to predict lnpwv for a man is lnpwv=1.3671+0.0116×entry age+0.008744×time. figure 4 . note that in women  figure 4b  the average rates of change in both pwv and pp over time increase monotonically at each successive entry age. in men however the average rates of change of pp and sbp and those of pwv over time exhibit substantial dissociation  figure 4a . although the rates of change in pwv increase steadily during the age span as in women the rates of change in pp in men initially increase but decline after the age of 50 years and the rates of change in sbp decline after the age of 40 years.\\nto control for bp on rates of change in pwv and for pwv on rates of change in the bps mixed-effects models for pwv with each bp as an additional covariate and for each bp with pwv as a covariate were fit to the data these models also control for heart rate and body mass index. tables s8 and s9 provide the parameter estimates of the final mixed-effects models. figures  s6 s7  and s8 display graphs of some of the fitted models.\\nin men when pwv is included as a covariate in the bp models it has only a main model effect on sbp dbp and pp but no association with the bps over time table s9a . higher pwv however is associated with lower longitudinal trajectories in mbp because of the significantly negative time×pwv interaction table s9a . in women pwv is associated with cross-sectional differences in all bps table s9b . as entry age increases the association of pwv on dbp and mbp decreases whereas that of pwv on pp increases table s9b . in women pwv is associated with longitudinal changes in sbp and dbp.\\nno bps are associated with longitudinal changes in pwv over time table s8a-s8d . however higher bp is associated with higher pwv at older entry ages for pp in men and women and for sbp in women because of the significantly positive entry age×bp interaction terms in tables s8a and s8d . in dbp and mbp in men and women and sbp in men bp is associated with higher pwv levels because of the positive parameter estimate of the main effect of the bp terms in the models. the perspectives given above are for average trajectories and rates of change. figure s11 in the online-only data supplement provides graphs that show the associations among individual rates of changes and initial values of the covariates.\\nthis is the first study to simultaneously examine both crosssectional measured at entry age and longitudinal rates of change of pwv and bp over time at each entry age in a large general population of men and women of broad age range at study entry. our cross-sectional measurements of pwv and bp in different subjects who differ in entry age are similar to those reported previously in cross-sectional studies. 14 [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] in addition to potential cohort effects age and other factors present in different individuals before entry into the study for example profile of intensity of risk factors intensity and duration that are associated with pwv or bp may affect the interpretation of cross-sectional data. however our longitudinal findings revealed a dissociation between trajectories of pwv and bp in men challenging the conventional wisdom of a direct simple relationship between arterial stiffness and the rise in systolic and pp with aging.\\nthe longitudinal trajectories of pwv that occur over time do not depend on entry age and their rates of change do not differ by sex figures 1-4 . a few prior longitudinal studies of arterial stiffness indexed by both pwv and bp 424-27 have been conducted in small samples. a recent report from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa 27 however describes longitudinal changes in pwv in 1200 subjects that are similar to those in the present study. interestingly the average rate of pwv increase in the present study ≈0.05 m/s per year for a 50-year-old man is strikingly similar to that reported recently in a smaller study population in which the rate of increase from the mid-50s to the mid-60s depended on an angiotensin ii type 1 receptor genotype.\\n24\\ninteractions of pwv bp and age: the conundrum\\na most important and novel observation of the present study is that the longitudinal rate of change or absolute direction of longitudinal bp change in men during the span of entry ages does not track with that of pwv. both sbp and pwv increase across the younger entry ages in men but at older entry ages while sbp increases the rate of bp increase in each subsequent age decade decreases while the rate at which pwv increases accelerates. in contrast to men in women the rate of increase in both pwv and the bps remain positive across the age range studied. although pwv and bp are clearly intertwined our linear mixed-effects models permitted us to statistically verify associations among bp and pwv tables s8 and s9 . as expected from the existing literature both pwv and bp are each related to cross-sectional differences of the other. however in some cases there are differences in the associations of each on the other's longitudinal trajectories.\\ninterestingly pwv was not associated with the longitudinal change in pp over time in either sex table s9a and s9b . in addition in men pwv was not associated with the longitudinal change in sbp and in women there is an association of pwv on longitudinal changes in sbp but this association declines as entry age increases. as might be expected pwv was inversely associated with the longitudinal change in dbp over time table s9b in women but not in men. this result confirms prior cross-sectional perspectives that dbp falls as central arteries stiffen. however in men pwv was associated with longitudinal changes in only mbp but in women pwv was associated with longitudinal changes in sbp and dbp but the association of pwv on longitudinal changes in sbp declines as entry age increases.\\nalthough pp and entry age are associated with pwv in men and women table s8a  and sbp and entry age are associated with pwv only in women table s8d  none of the bps are associated with differences in longitudinal pwv trajectories table s8a-s8d . in framingham bp evaluated at the previous visit is not independently associated with pwv increases that occur over time after accounting for pwv at the previous visit 4 an approach that differs from that of the present study in which bp at the same visit as pwv is used as a covariate in the linear mixed models to describe longitudinal changes in pwv while accounting for various covariates. in contrast to the present study in the blsa a higher sbp is associated with an accelerated rate of pwv increase in both men and women.\\nthe cross-sectional perspective of associations of sbp with age gleaned from the present results is that sbp continues to increase with each successive entry age decade figure 2  whereas the longitudinal perspective however indicates that at older ages in men in fact sbp decreases over time figures 2 3 and 4 . this suggests that the cross-sectional increase with entry age would have been even steeper if sbp before entry into the study in older men had not already begun to plateau or decline. clearly the waning of the rate at which sbp increases at older ages in men is the major factor that drives the divergence of the rates of change in pwv sbp and pp. although central bp was not measured in the present study brachial and central sbp converge with increasing age. the reduction in the rate at which sbp increases and later declines in men but not in women explains the long recognized convergence or crossover of cross-sectional measures of pp in women versus men with advancing age.\\none explanation for the divergence of the rates of change in pwv and sbp at older ages in men is that the reduction in the rate of increase and eventual decline in sbp reflects a concomitant deterioration in cardiodynamics and heartarterial coupling or change in wave reflection. a reduction in stroke volume however is not likely to be a cause because stroke volume does not decline with age in either men or women.\\ngiven that characteristic impedance a major determinant of sbp is a function of both pwv and aortic diameter squared per the water hammer equation 30 another explanation for the dissociation between sbp and pwv longitudinal trajectories in men is an increase in aortic diameter. indeed a greater rate of aortic root dilatation with increasing age in men than in women has been reported. 31 32 this study used echo and did not assess thoracic or abdominal aortic diameter or aortic tortuosity. nonetheless it is tempting to speculate therefore that an increase in the rate of aortic remodeling dilatation in men in the context of a continual increase in pwv in the absence of a change in stroke volume is a factor implicated in the sbp reduction in older men. an increased rate at which the aorta remodels dilates in men versus women could also be an explanation for the decline in the rate of increase followed by a reduction in the rate of change in dbp in men figures 2 and 4 . in women neither pp nor sbp decline on average at older ages and in fact the rate at which pp increases remains positive and pp continues to increase into advanced age figures 3 and 4b because the rate at which sbp increases is greater than that of dbp figures 3 and 4 . a sex-specific combination of aortic stiffening and aortic dilatation in women may account for the monotonic rates at which systolic and diastolic bp change and pp increases in women but not in men. inferences on sex differences in bp and aortic diameter have been drawn previously from cross-sectional data. 30 [33][34][35] finally an age-associated increase in bp per se may have a causal association with the age-associated aortic dilatation. indeed that the reduction in sbp is greater in those individuals with a higher sbp at entry age  figure  s12  might offer a clue to an association of bp on aortic remodeling. a chronic increase in bp itself via an effect to promote aortic dilatation reduces aortic impedance thus limiting a further bp increase or even resulting in a reduction in bp in the context of a progressive increase in arterial wall stiffness. hence the conundrum of aging arterial stiffness and bp likely results from both feed-forward and negative feedback interactions of bp aortic wall stiffness and aortic diameter over time as age increases. thus one plausible scenario is that as the aortic wall stiffens with age sbp increases this chronic increase in sbp leads to greater aortic dilatation in men than in women which reduces the rate at which sbp continues to increase in men. the dissociation of the continuous rate at which pwv accelerates over time from the rate at which bp changes as age increases in men clearly indicates that although inter-related changes in pwv and bp are intrinsically regulated by independent mechanisms.\\nthis study only used 2 or 3 repeated observations on each participant. this allows us to draw valid conclusions about longitudinal changes for only up to ≈5 years. the participants in this study enter at ages from 20 to >80 years. although this broad range of subject age at the study onset allows for the characterization of longitudinal pwv and bp trajectories over a wide range of entry ages people of older entry age have survived to that age and consequently some survivor bias in addition to other cohort effects may affect entry age effects. but longitudinal changes during the observational period do not suffer directly from this bias but are affected by age at entry. secular trends that occur during the observation period for example changes in lifestyle and diet might be reflected in the data. secular trends which develop during long periods of time and require long duration are unlikely to be a major issue in this study however because the data on each of the 3 waves were collected within a relatively short time period.\\nthe age-associated increase in arterial stiffness has long been considered to parallel or to cause the age-associated increase in bp. yet the rates at which pwv a measure of arterial stiffness and bp trajectories change over time within individuals who differ by age and sex have not been assessed and compared. this study determined the evolution of bp and aortic pwv trajectories during a 9.4-year follow-up in >4000 community-dwelling men and women of 20 to 100 years of age at entry into the sardinia study. analyses revealed that pwv accelerates with time during the observation period at about the same rate over the entire age range in both men and women. in men the longitudinal rate at which bp changed over time however did not generally parallel that of pwv acceleration. these findings indicate that pwv is not a surrogate for bp and that arterial properties other than arterial wall stiffness that vary by age and sex also modulate the bp trajectories during aging and lead to at national insthealth lib on november 12 2014 http://hyper.ahajournals.org/ downloaded from\\ndecember 2014 the dissociation of pwv pp and sbp trajectories in men. thus knowledge of the longitudinal trajectories of pwv and bp over time in the same individuals and whether the rates of change are constant or vary with age helps to elucidate the conundrum of the inter-relationship among aortic stiffness age and bp. these rates also provide crucial information for the design of future proof-of-concept studies for interventions on arterial stiffening.\",

that must seek the proper adult habitat. for practical reasons the search for cues that stimulate settlement and metamorphosis to the benthic stage have traditionally utilized either laboratory studies or field correlations between larval and adult distributions. in contrast we have developed an in situ technique that employs lab-reared fiddler crab uca pugndv larvae placed in mesh cages in realistic estuarine settings to address the roles of potential adult habitat cues for molting. we extended our prior work to examine the influence of sedment type on molting of megalopae. in addition we manipulated the duration of field exposure of megalopae to cues. in 2 series of experiments 1996 and 1997 we examined the importance of the nature of cues waterborne vs sediment habitat sandflat vs salt marsh duration of exposure to field cues 1 vs 3 d and field test site different marshes within an estuary. freshly collected marsh sediment stimulated molting to the benthic first crab stage whereas fresh sand &d not. contact with natural seawater overlying a marsh also stimulated molting compared to control megalopae in filtered seawater in the lab or field. moreover the response appeared additive: the highest molting rates were observed when megalopae were exposed to both marsh sediment and seawater. cages on the sandflat remained intact but filled with sediment and almost all megalopae died before molting. three days of field exposure to marsh sediments and seawater had a greater effect on molting than 1 d of exposure although megalopae were stimulated to molt following only the 1 d exposure period. in addition results were consistent in marshes that differed in sediment particle size. consistency in response among years and between marsh sites suggests a strong response of fiddler crab megalopae to natural marsh ecosystems.', 'd1a6ce27-6122-4d4c-ae33-4c657582a12c': 'abstract the authors thank the cameron school of business and its summer research

powerful technique in boosting the predictive performance by learning multiple related classification/regression/clustering tasks simultaneously. however solving the mtfl problem remains challenging when the feature dimension is extremely large. in this paper we propose a novel screening rule-that is based on the dual projection onto convex sets dpc-to quickly identify the inactive features-that have zero coefficients in the solution vectors across all tasks. one of the appealing features of dpc is that: it is safe in the sense that the detected inactive features are guaranteed to have zero coefficients in the solution vectors across all tasks. thus by removing the inactive features from the training phase we may have substantial savings in the computational cost and memory usage without sacrificing accuracy. to the best of our knowledge it is the first screening rule that is applicable to sparse models with multiple data matrices. a key challenge in deriving dpc is to solve a nonconvex problem. we show that we can solve for the global optimum efficiently via a properly chosen parametrization of the constraint set. moreover dpc has very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers. we have evaluated the proposed dpc rule on both synthetic and real data sets. the experiments indicate that dpc is very effective in identifying the inactive

prostate-specific antigen psa in combination with digital rectal examination forms the basis for current prostate cancer cap screening programs. although psa screening was recently shown to reduce cap-specific mortality in the european randomized trial its limitations include the risk for unnecessary prostate biopsy and the diagnosis and treatment of some cap that might never have caused suffering or death. a potential way to minimize these pitfalls is through the use of derivatives of psa particularly psa kinetics to increase the specificity for clinically relevant cap. cap is the second-leading cause of cancer death in men in the united states and many other westernized countries accordingly judicious screening of healthy men allows for diagnosis sufficiently early that all options i.e. treatment or surveillance are still available in most cases. jnccn 20108:265-270 and that serum levels increase in the setting of prostatic disease led to its current application as a cap marker.\\n12 it is now used to screen for cap and monitor disease course.\\nbeginning in 1989 the authors\\' research group performed the initial large-scale study of psa and digital rectal examination dre as first-line tests for cap screening.\\n2 because abnormalities of psa alone were not considered sufficient to recommend a prostate biopsy at that time the first phase of the trial screening was performed in a sequential fashion whereby a verified psa greater than 4 ng/ml prompted additional evaluation with dre and transrectal ultrasonography trus. findings suspicious for cap on either dre or trus were then used as a trigger for biopsy. in this first phase of the study a greater proportion 43% of cancers would have been missed by trus than by psa or dre suggesting psa and dre as the best 2-test combination. 2 because of the complementary nature of psa and dre the authors changed the study protocol in 1991 to include these simultaneous measurements. prostate biopsy was recommended for suspicious dre results or a psa level greater than 4 ng/ml. this phase of the screening study showed that psa detected more cancers than dre and that cancers detected with psa-based screening were more likely to be organ-confined than those identified with dre alone.\\n3 because serial screening showed that nearly half of men with initially low psa levels that had risen above 2.5 ng/ml continued to experience an increase to greater than 4 ng/ml within 4 years in 1995 the authors reduced the psa threshold for biopsy to 2.5 ng/ml similar to the threshold of 3 ng/ ml used in the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer erspc. 4 from this study the authors learned that psa is the prostate-specific antigen psa blood test is the foundation for modern prostate cancer cap screening. initially it was used in forensic medicine. the subsequent discovery that it could be measured in serum \\n9% 11% and 22% for patients with pretreatment psa levels of less than 4 4 to 10 10 to 20 and 20.1 to 50 ng/ml respectively. 9 on multivariable analysis psa was significantly associated with cap-specific mortality after radical prostatectomy p = .021 in addition to the biopsy gleason score.\\nfinally the erspc showed that screening using a psa threshold of 3 ng/ml at most screening sites reduced cap-specific mortality by 20% 27% in men who were actually screened and the rate of metastatic disease by 41% at 9 years. 4 thus level 1 evidence from a randomized trial in which psa screening reduced cap mortality used a relatively low psa threshold for recommending biopsy. a second randomized trial the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian plco screening trial used a psa threshold of 4 ng/ml and did not find a difference in cap mortality between the screening and control arms.\\n10 nevertheless other aspects of the plco trial including high rates of screening in both groups before trial entry substantial contamination opportunistic screening in the control arm and delays in biopsy after abnormal results likely accounted for differences between its results and those of the erspc.\\nthe although the ideal screening test would have both 100% sensitivity and specificity for detecting a disease this is virtually never the case in clinical medicine. accordingly the selection of a cutoff value for clinical use involves an ever-present trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\\nspecificity is important because the confirmatory prostate biopsy for abnormal screening results involves both cost and potential risk. the use of a higher psa threshold increases the likelihood of a delayed or missed cancer diagnosis but decreases the proportion of unnecessary prostate biopsies and subuseful to assess the current and future risk for cap. in addition caps detected at lower psa levels generally but not always have more favorable tumor features and are more likely to be cured with definitive treatment. although lower psa thresholds reduce the specificity of psa-based screening the authors believe that these shortcomings may be overcome partly through use of psa velocity psav percent free psa fpsa and other adjunctive measures. controversy is currently ongoing regarding the extent of diagnosing potentially indolent cap through screening.\\n5 nevertheless more judicious screening practices together with the uncoupling of diagnosis and treatment decisions may allow the maximal benefit from screening.\\nthe fda approved the psa test for monitoring patients with established cap in 1986 and in 1994 approved psa as an aid for early detection of cap using 4 ng/ml as the upper limit of normal. nevertheless even at psa levels less than 4 ng/ml a direct relationship exists between psa with cap risk and tumor aggressiveness. among men with psa levels less than 4 ng/ml and nonsuspicious dre in the prostate cancer prevention trial 15.2% had cap on biopsy.\\n6 furthermore on multivariate analysis the odds ratio for high-grade disease was 2.08 per unit increase in psa 95% ci 1.64-2.64 p < .001.\\nthe psa level at diagnosis also predicts outcomes after definitive cap treatment. for example the authors\\' research group previously compared radical prostatectomy pathology features among men diagnosed with cap at psa levels of 0 to 2.5 2.6 to 4.0 4.1 to 10.0 and greater than 10.0 ng/ ml.\\n7 both tumor volume and the proportion of non-organ-confined disease were significantly higher with increasing psa p < .0001. furthermore 10-year progression-free survival rates were 88% 80% 76% and 61% for patients with clinical stage t1c cap diagnosed at psa levels of 2.6 to 4.0 4.1 to 7.0 7.1 to 10.0 and greater than 10.0 ng/ml p = .0001 respectively. an illustration of the sensitivity-specificity trade-off was described by welch et al. 13 in men aged 40 to 69 years from the 2001-2002 national health and nutrition examination survey. based on the psa distributions in these men they estimated that approximately 1.5 million men in the united states have psa levels greater than 4 ng/ml. a reduction in the psa threshold from 4.0 to 2.5 ng/ml would additionally label approximately 1.8 million men as abnormal. however these men would appropriately be labeled as being at a substantially greater risk for cap.\\nin the authors\\' screening study men in their 40s and 50s had median psa levels of 0.7 and 0.9 ng/ ml respectively.\\n14 moreover the baseline psa level at a young age is a useful predictor of future cap risk. for example a psa level between 0.7 and 2.5 ng/ ml the threshold for biopsy in men in their 40s was associated with a greater than 14-fold increased risk for subsequent cap detection. in men in their 50s a psa level between the age-specific median 0.9 ng/ml and 2.5 ng/ml conferred a 7.6-fold increased risk for cap. data from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa similarly showed that a comparison of the baseline psa to the agespecific median value is useful for risk-assessment. 15 whittemore et al. 16 also reported on the association between psa at a young age with future cap risk. accordingly the nccn clinical practice guidelines in oncology: prostate cancer early detection in this issue to view the most recent version of these guidelines visit the nccn web site at www. nccn.org suggest offering an initial psa test at age 40 to establish a baseline and guide the subsequent screening protocol.\\na final disadvantage of using lower psa thresholds is the diagnosis of tumors that may not cause harm. for example the erspc authors estimated that 1410 men would need to be screened and 48 treated to prevent 1 cap death at 9 years.\\n4 nevertheless this number-needed-to-treat nnt estimate was made just as the survival curves began to separate and therefore may decrease with additional follow-up. 18 a final consideration is that many published studies emphasize cap mortality as the primary end point of interest however the prevention of local progression and metastatic disease are also important goals. it is noteworthy that the nnt was approximately 25 to prevent 1 case of metastatic cap when comparing the screening and control arms of the erspc and 15 when comparing the er-spc screening arm with the unscreened population of northern ireland.\\nin general psa-based screening particularly using lower thresholds may lead to diagnosis of some cap cases that would otherwise remain asymptomatic. however as stated in a recent editorial by smith 20 \"treatment or non-treatment decisions can be made once a cancer is found but not knowing about it in the first place surely burns bridges.\"\\nit is noteworthy that the updated nccn prostate cancer early detection guidelines in this issue and at www.nccn.org are designed for individuals who have made an informed decision to undergo screening and state that \"it is neither the intent nor the suggestion of the panel that all men diagnosed with prostate cancer require treatment.\"\\n17 diagnosis does not necessitate aggressive treatment. rather intelligent screening practices followed by more selective use of effective high-quality treatment can help reduce adverse effects of diagnosing and treating cancers not destined to cause symptoms while enabling potentially curative therapy for patients who are more likely to benefit.\\noesterling et al. 21 studied psa levels among 471 presumed healthy unscreened men from a minnesota community. based on the 95th percentile of psa distribution in these men they proposed a series of age-specific psa thresholds: 2.5 ng/ml in the 40s 3.5 ng/ml in the 50s 4.5 ng/ml in the 60s and 6.5 ng/ml in the 70s. age-specific reference ranges have also been reported in populations with different ethnicities. 22 23 possible reasons to use a higher psa threshold for biopsy in older men are the increasing prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph with advancing age and a greater risk for death from competing causes. accordingly rather than recommending the use of age-specific psa thresholds some experts now recommend discontinuing psa screening altogether after a certain age. for example the newly updated united states preventive services task force \\nrecently the authors have moved away from an approach to cap screening based exclusively upon the absolute psa value given increasing evidence showing a potential role for psa kinetics in predicting cap risk and aggressiveness. carter et al. 27 reported that psa levels had a nonsignificant increase over time in controls compared with a gradual rise in psa in men with histologically confirmed bph leading up to simple prostatectomy and an exponential increase in psa approximately 10 years before diagnosis among participants with cap. thus they suggested that psav i.e. psa trajectory over time could help distinguish between bph and cap.\\nin a screening program from austria berger et al. 28 subsequently reported an annualized psav of 0.39 ng/ml per year and 0.03 ng/ml per year respectively in men who were and were not diagnosed with cap over the 10 years before biopsy or censorship.\\nin the authors\\' screening study the median psav in the year before diagnosis was 0.6 to 0.7 ng/ml per year for men in all age groups 40-49 50-59 60-69 and ≥ 70 years with cap compared with 0 to 0.1 ng/ ml per year in controls p < .005.\\nas with psa psav also predicts cap aggressiveness. among patients in the authors\\' radical prostatectomy series with gleason scores of 6 7 and 8 to 10 the median preoperative psav was 0.84 0.97 and 1.39 ng/ml per year respectively p = .05.\\n30 with respect to long-term outcomes psav is a strong predictor of cap-specific mortality after radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.\\n3132 a psav greater than 0.35 ng/ml per year was also shown to distinguish men at risk for life-threatening cap more than 10 years before diagnosis at a time when total psa levels were low.\\n33 accordingly the nccn prostate cancer early detection guidelines in this issue and at www.nccn.org recommend considering a prostate biopsy for men with a psa less than 4 ng/ml who have a suspicious psav greater than 0.35 ng/ml per year.\\na novel and potentially more reliable way to examine psa kinetics is the psav risk count 34 which is the number of serial occasions that psav exceeds a specific threshold such as 0.4 ng/ml per year. the blsa showed that 2 serial psavs greater than 0.4 ng/ml per year conferred a greater risk of life-threatening cap than 1 or no psav measure-uspstf clinical practice guidelines recommend against cap screening in men older than 75 years.\\nthese guidelines have generated controversy in both the medical community and general public. for example moul et al. 25 surveyed 340 men presenting for a free cap screening and reported that 78% were \"upset\" by this recommendation. more significantly these guidelines were issued in the absence of level 1 evidence on screening in men older than 75 years. the maximum age was 74 years for enrollment in the erspc and plco randomized trials of cap screening and the erspc core age group included men aged 55 to 69 years.\\n410 accordingly the benefits or lack thereof of screening in older men cannot be assessed from these data.\\nother professional organizations such as the american cancer society and american urological association instead recommend discontinuing cap screening for men with a life expectancy less than 10 years. similarly the updated nccn prostate cancer early detection guidelines state that \"screening in men over 75 years should be considered individually.\" 17 the authors believe that this represents a more personalized and rational approach than applying a single age cutoff to all men regardless of comorbidities.\\nfurthermore the authors do not use age-specific psa reference ranges for recommending a biopsy. once the decision is made to proceed with screening they believe that all men who are healthy enough to receive psa testing should be provided the same opportunity for detection at a curable stage. their research group previously reported similar pathologic tumor features in men younger than 60 years aged 60 to 70 years and older than 70 years diagnosed with cap at psa levels between 2.6 and 4.0 ng/ml. 26 furthermore none of the tumors in men older than 70 years who underwent radical prostatectomy fulfilled published pathologic criteria for potentially insignificant cap suggesting that clinically significant cap may be detected at psa levels between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml among men older than 70 years. thus men in this age group with sufficient life expectancy to undergo screening should be provided the same opportunity for early diagnosis permitting an informed discussion of the appropriate subsequent management. ments greater than 0.4 ng/ml per year. additional study is necessary to test the psav risk count concept in screening.\\nlimitations of psav are that a lengthy psa history is not always available and potential confounding from differences in psa assay standardization 35 and from prostatitis.\\n36 thus the nccn prostate cancer early detection guidelines in this issue and at www.nccn.org suggest that \"antibiotic therapy and repeated psa measurements may be considered to minimize these sources of confusion.\"\\n17 this is another reason why psav risk count may be particularly useful because it indicates a persistently rising psa trajectory over serial psav evaluations.\\nnot all studies have shown that psav adds incremental predictive value for cap diagnosis or prognosis beyond a single psa measurement.\\nthis may relate to the method of psav calculation insufficient psa measurements over lengthy or variable time intervals 38 or colinearity between psa and psav.\\nin addition to psav other psa derivatives e.g. percent fpsa other psa isoforms and psa density may help increase the specificity of screening. for example a multi-institutional study previously examined the usefulness of percent fpsa among men with psa levels of 4 to 10 ng/ml and nonsuspicious dre. 40 applying a 25% fpsa cutoff in these men would have detected 95% of cancers while avoiding 20% of unnecessary biopsies. 40 moreover a percent fpsa greater than 25% was significantly associated with low-grade low-volume disease at radical prostatectomy suggesting that it may increase specificity of screening for clinically significant cap. accordingly among men with a psa of 4 to 10 ng/ml and major comorbidities that may impact the cost-to-benefit ratio of biopsy the nccn prostate cancer early detection guidelines in this issue and at www.nccn. org suggest using percent fpsa to aid in decisionmaking. in addition percent fpsa is used to help assess the need for repeat biopsy.\\nother approaches to screening include the use of personal risk calculators that incorporate individual risk factors such as race and family history. 41 finally new markers such as pca3 are currently being examined for a potential role in cap screening. 42 43 one particularly promising new marker -2 propsa was recently approved in europe and may help selectively identify more aggressive cap.\\n44\\nthe authors recommend psa screening for healthy men older than 40 years with greater than a 10-year life expectancy. for men who have decided to undergo screening the authors agree with the nccn guidelines recommendation to offer a baseline psa and dre at age 40 years considering the strong relationship between the baseline psa value and future cap risk. subsequent serial psa measurements can also be used to establish the baseline psav. a psav greater than 0.35 ng/ml per year predicts lifethreatening cap many years before diagnosis at a time when psa is low. thus psav may be useful to facilitate the diagnosis of potentially life-threatening disease within the window for curability. other psa derivatives such as percent fpsa and -2 propsa may also be useful to increase the specificity of psabased screening. \\nreferences', 'd8beacd0-16e2-4034-aec0-3e16bb819074': ' educational

investigated changes of western north pacific land-falling tropical cyclone tc characteristics due to warmer climate conditions using the pseudo-global-warming pgw technique. historical simulations of three intense tcs making landfall in pearl river delta prd were first conducted using the weather research and forecasting wrf model. the same cases were then re-simulated by superimposing

projections according to the representative concentration pathway rcp 8.5 scenario. peak intensities of tcs maximum surface wind in their lifetimes are expected to increase by ~ 3 10% in the near far future. further experiments indicate that surface warming alone acts to intensify tcs by enhancing sea surface heat flux while warmer atmosphere acts in the opposite way by increasing the stability. in the far future associated storm surges are also estimated to increase by about 8.5% computed by the sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh model. combined with sea level rise and estimated land vertical displacement tc-induced storm tide affecting prd will increase by ~1 m in the future 2075-2099 period.\\nproducing almost 30% of global tropical cyclones tcs the western north pacific wnp is the most active tc basin on the earth. associated with strong winds heavy rainfall and high storm surges wnp tcs pose great threats to lives and cause significant economic and societal losses to cities along the asian coastline. adjacent to the south china sea the pearl river delta prd region is one of the highly-urbanized megacity groups in china which is also strongly affected by these storm systems 1-3 . prd has experienced devastating floods induced by tcs related heavy rainfall and storm surges. super typhoon hato 2017 caused a maximum storm surge of 2.79 m in zhuhai https://www.weather.gov.hk/informtc/hato17/hato.htm and super typhoon mangkhut 2018 induced surges reaching 3.40 m in hong kong https://www.weather.gov.hk/informtc/mangkhut18/mangkhut. htm. according to projections using general circulation models gcms tcs may intensify globally 4-7 and also sea level rise slr may accelerate 89 under global warming. their combined effects will lead to increase of flood risks to the prd area.\\nhowever tc physics cannot be realistically represented by gcms due to their relatively coarse resolution 10 . studies have also shown that there can be substantial variations in the response of tcs to climate change over different ocean basins 611  while gcms may introduce large biases when reproducing tcs activities over different regions as the result of their low resolution. by embedding high-resolution regional models within a gcm dynamical downscaling provides a powerful way to reproduce tcs with more realistic circulation structure intensity and frequency. for example by further downscaling outputs from the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl high resolution atmospheric model hiram 50-km grid with the gfdl hurricane model at 6-km resolution 12  it was found that more realistic tcs with stronger intensity can be simulated. the downscaled outputs from gfdl hurricane model projected an overall decreased tc frequency but with more intense storms over wnp in response to anthropogenic global warming. it was also demonstrated that there would be a continuing poleward migration of wnp tcs following the emissions projections of the representative concentration pathway rcp 8.5 based on dynamical downscaling of 9 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 models 13 .\\nbesides carrying out downscaling of outputs from individual gcms the impacts of warmer climate on tcs can also be explored using the pseudo-global-warming pgw method 14 15 . pgw is a more effective and economical way compared to traditional regional downscaling methods and it provides a possible way to investigate responses of historical tcs to future climate change. in the pgw technique differences of environmental thermal and dynamical forcings such as sea surface temperature sst atmospheric temperature humidity and wind field between current and future climates simulated by gcms are firstly obtained. these perturbations will then be added to the initial and boundary conditions for the historical cases to generate future climate conditions 15 . the pgw method has been used to examine the responses of snow storm 16 and baiu rain-band 17 to future global warming and it has become increasingly popular for investigating changes in tcs for both idealized 18 and real cases [19] [20] [21] . coupled with the finite volume community ocean model fvcom changes of wnp tc haiyan 2013 and its induced storm surge according to four scenarios proposed by the fifth assessment report ar5 of intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc were analyzed using pgw 22 . it was found that the drop of minimum sea level pressure slp for tc haiyan could be as large as 21 hpa with a 2.7 m increase of maximum storm surge under rcp 8.5 if only sst warming was considered. on the other hand such strong intensification would be significantly reduced by incorporating the effect of air temperature warming. in fact if sst air temperature and humidity are fully taken into account the minimum slp of tc haiyan will just decrease by 13 hpa and the storm surge will increase by 0.7 m. overall the pgw technique is a useful tool for accessing how global warming might impact on weather systems provided that storms with similar tracks appear in the future under similar synoptic conditions.\\nin this study we evaluate the impacts of future global warming on wnp tcs using pgw based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model 23 with a horizontal resolution of 5 km and quantify the influences on storm surges with a numerical storm surge model namely the sea lake and overland surges from hurricanes slosh model 24 . three intense tcs that brought high storm surges in hong kong coastal areas are chosen and their potential responses to global warming through pgw method are investigated. the tracks intensities and storm size information are then applied to drive the slosh model in order to evaluate changes of induced storm surges in

is that the effect of disease on mortality is to add a constant amount to death rates once the disease progresses from an early to late stage. we explored the properties of the proposed model in particular the behavior of the mortality rate ratio and median survival that is induced by the model. we combined information from several data sources to estimate the parameter in our model. we found that the effect of alzheimer's disease on longevity is to increase the absolute annual risk of death by about 8% once a person progressed to late stage disease. most importantly we find that this

students. these data are used throughout this journal issue but a key question raised in this article is whether these data can be used to determine if the special education system is adequately and appropriately serving the nation's population of disabled children. the analysis suggests that the osep count data by themselves do not indicate how many children have disabilities and what types of disabilities they have and although the data quantify the number of children receiving services they cannot be used to evaluate whether the services received are appropriate for those children's needs.\\nthe federal data do however show large variations in the numbers and proportions of children who are served in special education programs over time and across jurisdictions. osep data indicate a large increase in the number of children served in special education programs since the 1976-77 school year. much of the increase appears to be the result of an increase in the number of children classified as having specific learning disabilities a classification that is not well defined and is under considerable debate. despite the overall growth trend the proportion of children who are in special education varies by state from 5% of children in special education in hawaii to 11% in massachusetts. in addition different states use different classification systems to describe children in special education programs. because of these differences population-based data on the prevalence of disabilities among children would be helpful in determining the actual number of children who might benefit from special education services. the prevalence data could be compared with the osep count data to assess in gross terms the adequacy of special education services delivered

between early marijuana use at age 14 or younger and young people's educational outcomes. we find evidence that early marijuana use is related to educational penalties that are compounded by high-intensity use and are larger for young people living in families with a history of welfare receipt. the relationships between marijuana use and both high school completion and achieving a university entrance score appear to stem from selectivity into the use of marijuana. in contrast early marijuana use is associated with significantly lower university entrance score for those who obtain one and we provide evidence that this effect is unlikely to be driven by selection. collectively these findings point to a more nuanced view of the relationship between adolescent marijuana use

non-minority students are arguably the most important educational problem in the united states. in particular reducing or eliminating these gaps by raising the achievement of minority students is widely seen as a critical component of promoting broader social equality with respect to a variety of outcomes like educational attainment and earnings as well as crime health and family structure e.g. christopher jencks and meredith phillips 1998 . the more modest gender gaps in achievement are also viewed as a prominent policy concern particularly with respect to the fields of science and mathematics e.g. american association of university women 1992. the recent federal legislation the no child left behind nclb act of 2001 clearly reflects these concerns explicitly requiring that these demographic subgroups make \"adequate yearly progress\" towards proficiency on state tests.\\nnclb also emphasizes that schools should meet these and other goals by implementing effective reforms grounded in \"scientifically based\" research. however the available empirical evidence suggests that the determinants of the demographic achievement gaps are not very well understood. for example jencks and phillips 1998 argue that traditional explanations for the black-white achievement gaps i.e. those based on income inequality differences in family structure and school spending actually have relatively little explanatory power. they also suggest that more successful future explanations of achievement gaps are likely to be based on credible data that assess more nuanced hypotheses about the dynamics within schools classrooms and families.\\nthe notion that the classroom dynamics between teachers and students make a substantive contribution to the demographic gaps in achievement already has a wide currency among educational researchers and commentators. for example proposals for promoting racial and gender equity often emphasize the need for improvements in teacher training and professional development e.g. ronald f. ferguson 1998  american association of university women 1992. another frequently recurring proposal for increasing the relative achievement of minority student is to improve the recruitment and retention of minority teachers e.g. beatriz\\nchu clewell and ana maría villegas 1998 national commission on teaching and america\\'s future 1996 joint center for political studies 1989  patricia a. graham 1987 . however the evidence that the demographic interactions between students and teachers matter is surprisingly thin sometimes contradictory and usually based on small localized samples.\\nin this study i present new evidence on this issue by evaluating whether assignment to a demographically similar teacher influences the teacher\\'s subjective evaluations of student behavior and performance. this analysis is based on a large nationally representative survey the national education longitudinal study of 1988 nels:88. these data allow me to examine whether the effects of demographically similar teachers vary with key student traits or across census regions. however the key innovation of this analysis arguably involves how the identification strategy exploits a unique feature of the nels:88 survey design to purge the potential biases created by the non-random sorting of students across and within schools.\\nspecifically for each of the 8 th grade students surveyed nels:88 solicited student-specific evaluations from teachers in two distinct academic subjects. this unusual feature of the data makes it possible to implement a fixed effect econometric specification that essentially identifies how two demographically different teachers evaluated the same student.\\njeffrey m. wooldridge 2002 page 492 cautions that it is misleading to state that this approach \"conditions\" on the unobserved fixed effects. instead this approach relies on describing a conditional density that allows us to identify the \"structural\" coefficients from the available data.\\nnonetheless i found that ordinary least-squares ols estimates based on linear probability models that do condition on student fixed effects return results quite similar to those based on this approach. table 2 presents the key results from fixed-effect logit models based on the full sample and for each of the three binary outcomes. since this estimation strategy does not actually generate estimates of the student fixed effects we cannot directly evaluate the partial effects of 1 one implication of this approach is that only the observations with within-student variation in the dependent variable contribute to the likelihood function. this explains why the sample sizes reported here are smaller than the total sample and vary across dependent variables.', 'e32d24d8-bc41-401c-b49d-99b93c2d4533': 'abstract in the united states girls outperform boys in measures of reading achievement while generally underperforming in science and mathematics.

perceptions of student performance and student engagement. this study\\'s identification strategy exploits a unique \"matched pairs\" feature of a major longitudinal survey. within-student comparisons based on these data indicate that assignment to a same-gender teacher significantly improves the achievement of both girls and boys as well as teacher perceptions of student performance and student engagement with the teacher\\'s subject. for example assignment to a female science teacher increases the likelihood that a girl views science as useful for her future. however because the

to facilitate making this distinction and thus aid the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders we propose a method for developing a spatio-temporal model of morphological differences in the brain due to normal aging. the method utilizes groupwise image registration to characterize morphological variation across brain scans of people with different ages. to extract the deformations that are due to normal aging we use partial least squares regression which yields modes of deformations highly correlated with age and corresponding scores for each input subject. subsequently we determine a distribution of morphologies as a function of age by fitting smooth percentile curves to these scores. this distribution is used as a reference to which a person's morphology score can be compared. we validate our method on two different datasets using images from both cognitively normal subjects and patients with alzheimer disease ad. results show that the proposed framework extracts the expected atrophy patterns. moreover the morphology scores of cognitively normal subjects are on average lower than the scores of ad subjects indicating that morphology differences between ad subjects and

documented that both muscle mass and strength decline with age 17 20 . this decline is associated with an increased risk of falls 6 hip fractures 4 and adverse physiological changes such as glucose intolerance 5 and a loss of bone mineral density 29. consequently these changes may predispose elderly individuals to osteoporosis atherosclerosis and diabetes as well as to functional limitations in activities of daily living 16.\\nalthough many previous studies have assessed agerelated declines in absolute strength by using measurements of isometric iso and/or concentric con force production 9 12 17  few studies have examined changes in eccentric ecc strength with age. information regarding the relationship between ecc strength and age may have important functional implications for the elderly because ecc muscle actions play a vital role in normal ambulatory activities by providing stabilization and deceleration forces 14 30. the studies available suggest that ecc strength in humans may be less affected by age than is con strength 15 27 27a 28 32 particularly at higher velocities 15 28. additionally in a preliminary study 22 we observed a gender difference in the age-associated change in ecc strength. however the results of gender difference with age are conflicting 15 27 27a 28 32 and these studies have used relatively small sample sizes and limited age ranges 15 27 27a 28 32. furthermore no data were presented in any of these studies that would provide evidence explaining gender differences in ecc strength. thus there is a need to further examine this issue by using a larger sample size of men and women representing a wide age range.\\nage-associated changes in the mechanical and elastic properties of the passive component connective tissue have been postulated as one factor that could preserve ecc strength 14. these changes could increase the resistance to stretch during an ecc action without affecting the con or iso force production 15. indeed age-related increases in connective tissue 21 and collagen cross-linking 1 have been reported that might enhance the elastic potential and increase ecc force production. one method of assessing the mechanical and elastic properties of the muscle in vivo is to measure the stretch-shortening cycle ssc. the ssc reflects the ability of the muscle to store and recover elastic energy from an ecc action. gender differences in the ssc have been reported in young subjects 18 suggesting that men and women may differ in their ability to store elastic energy. whether such gender differences persist into later life is unknown.\\nmuscle quality strength per unit of muscle is an important indicator of muscle performance and is thought to decline with age in men 9 17 26 34 but not in women 33. however gender differences have not been assessed in the same study throughout a wide age range. furthermore only one study has addressed the effects of age on muscle quality when using ecc peak torque 15.\\ntherefore the main purpose of this study was to compare age and gender differences in iso con and ecc peak torque in the knee extensors. to help explain age and gender relationships to ecc strength levels the ability to store and utilize elastic energy was examined by using the ssc in a representative subset of subjects. the effects of age gender and type of muscle action con vs. ecc on muscle quality was also examined.', 'e95faf0c-91fd-4bb6-a544-0bbad05f629b': \"abstract keywords: paleotempestology paleohurricane hurricane tropical cyclone sinkhole storm surge slosh gulf of mexico apalachee bay holocene a 4500-year record of hurricane-induced storm surges is developed from sediment cores collected from a coastal sinkhole near apalachee bay florida. recent deposition of sand layers in the upper sediments of the pond was found to be contemporaneous with significant historic storm surges at the site modeled using slosh and the best track post-1851 a.d. dataset. using the historic portion of the record for calibration paleohurricane deposits were identified by sand content and dated using radiocarbon-based age models. marine-indicative foraminifera some originating at least 5 km offshore were present in several modern and ancient storm deposits. the presence and long-term preservation of offshore foraminifera suggest that this site and others like it may yield promising microfossil-based paleohurricane reconstructions in the future. due to the sub-decadal ~7 years resolution of the record and the site's high susceptibility to hurricane-generated storm surges the average local frequency of recorded events approximately 3.9 storms per century is greater than that of previously published paleohurricane records from the region. the high incidence of recorded events permitted a time series of local hurricane frequency during the last five millennia to be constructed. variability in the frequency of the largest storm layers was found to be greater than what would likely occur by chance alone with intervals of both anomalously high and low storm frequency identified. however the rate at which smaller layers were deposited was relatively constant over the last five millennia. this may suggest that significant variability in hurricane frequency has occurred only in the highest magnitude events. the frequency of high magnitude events peaked near 6 storms per century between 2800 and 2300 years ago. high magnitude events were relatively rare with about 0-3 storms per century occurring between 1900 and 1600 years ago and between 400 and 150

isobaric tandem mass tag tmt mass spectrometry and offline prefractionation. results: our new tmt pipeline allowed us to more than double the depth of brain proteome coverage. this increased depth of coverage greatly expanded the brain protein network to reveal new protein modules that correlated with disease and were unrelated to those identified in our previous network. differential protein abundance analysis identified 350 proteins that had altered levels between asymad and ad not caused by changes in specific cell type abundance potentially reflecting biochemical changes that are associated with cognitive decline in ad. rna binding proteins emerged as a class of proteins altered between asymad and ad and were enriched in network modules that correlated with ad pathology. we developed a proteogenomic approach to investigate rna splicing events that may be altered by rna binding protein changes in ad. the increased proteome depth afforded by our tmt pipeline allowed us to identify and quantify a large number of alternatively spliced protein isoforms in brain including ad risk factors such as bin1 picalm ptk2b and fermt2. many of the new ad protein network modules were enriched in alternatively spliced proteins and correlated with molecular markers of ad pathology and cognition. conclusions: further analysis of the ad brain proteome will continue to yield new

attend colleges of lesser quality. however it is unclear why this differential occurs. do students who attend more selective schools learn skills that make them more productive workers as would be suggested by human capital theory? or consistent with signaling models do higher-ability students-who are likely to become more productive workers-attend more selective colleges?\\nunderstanding why students who attend higher-quality colleges have greater earn-\\nthe journal of human resources 324 ings is crucial for parents deciding where to send their children to college for colleges selecting students and for policymakers deciding whether to invest additional resources in higher-quality institutions. however obtaining unbiased estimates of the effects of college characteristics is diffi cult because of unobserved characteristics that affect both a student's attendance at a highly selective college and his or her later earnings. in particular the same characteristics such as ambition that lead students to apply to highly selective colleges may also be rewarded in the labor market. likewise the attributes that admissions offi cers are looking for when selecting students for college may be similar to the attributes that employers are seeking when hiring and promoting workers.\\na wide literature exists on the labor market effects of college characteristics as summarized in hoxby 2009 and hershbein 2013 . many papers have used regression models to control for observed student characteristics such as high school grades standardized test scores and parental background see for example monks 2000 brewer and ehrenberg 1996 black and smith 2004  and generally fi nd that attending a higher-quality college is associated with higher earnings. however studies that attempt to adjust for unobserved student quality have reported mixed fi ndings. dale and krueger 2002 fi nd that the effect of college characteristics falls substantially after implementing their selection-correction which partially adjusts for unobserved student quality by controlling for the average student sat score of the colleges that students apply to and are accepted or rejected by. hoekstra 2009 uses a regression discontinuity design that compares the earnings of students who were just above the admissions cutoff for a state university to those that were just below it he fi nds that attending the fl agship state university results in 20 percent higher earnings 5 to 10 years after graduation for white men but he does not fi nd an effect on earnings for white women. using an instrumental variables strategy long 2008 did not fi nd a consistent relationship between college characteristics and earnings. lindahl and regner 2005 use sibling data to illustrate that the effect of college quality might be overstated if family characteristics are not fully adjusted for because cross-sectional estimates are twice as large as within-family estimates. it is important to note that most of the above literature has used a single college characteristic-such as school average sat score expenditures per student the barron's index or whether the student attended a fl agship state university-as a proxy for college quality. however black and smith 2006 show that the estimates of the effects of school quality are attenuated when a single measure is used the effects of composite measures are higher.\\none recent study hershbein 2013  has tried to distinguish between human capital models and signaling models by assessing how the relationship between grade point average gpa college selectivity and wages changes over time. he fi nds that the return to gpa is smaller at more selective schools than at less selective schools which is consistent with signaling models. the marginal benefi t of information about gpa is lower at more selective schools because attending a highly selective college already sends a signal about student ability.\\nfinally some papers have examined the returns to college quality over time both within and across cohorts. these studies have generally found that when later cohorts are compared to earlier cohorts the premium to attending college has increased brewer et al. 1999 bound and johnson 1992 long 2009 grogger and eide 1995 katz and murphy 1992 . however black daniel and smith 2005 show that the effects of college quality for a single cohort-the 1979 cohort of the national longitudinal survey of youth nlsy-remain stable over an 11-year horizon.\\nlittle research has examined the effects of college characteristics for recent cohorts. this is a notable gap in the literature one might expect that it would be more important for students who entered college recently to distinguish themselves by attending more selective colleges because the percentage of students enrolling in college has increased.\\n1 those studies that do use recent cohorts tend to model earnings early in the career. for example long 2008 long   2009  used a relatively recent cohort the 1992 cohort of the national education longitudinal study [nels]  but he was only able to examine the earnings of students relatively early in their careers when they were only 26 years old.\\nin this paper we examine whether the college that students attend within a set of somewhat selective to highly selective colleges affects their later earnings. this paper replicates earlier work that examined the relationship between the college that students attended in 1976 and the earnings they reported in 1995 in the college and beyond c&b followup survey dale and krueger 2002  it also extends this earlier work in important respects. first we estimate the effects of several college characteristics that are commonly used as proxies for college quality college average sat score the barron's index and net tuition for a recent cohort of students-those who entered college in 1989. by linking the c&b data to administrative records from the social security administration ssa we are able to follow this cohort for 18 years after the students entered and 14 years after they likely would have graduated from college. second we estimate the return to college characteristics for the 1976 cohort over a long time horizon from 1983 to 2007. because we use administrative earnings records from tax data our earnings measure is presumably more reliable than much of the prior literature which is generally based on self-reported earnings. the use of administrative earnings data allows us to follow a recent cohort of students over a longer period of time than is possible in many of the longitudinal databases that are typically used to study the returns to college characteristics. for example the nels high school and beyond and the national longitudinal study of the high school class of 1972 nls-72 only follow students for 6 to 10 years after they would have likely graduated from college although the nlsy follows students for a longer period of time students from the relatively recent cohort who were ages 12 to 16 in 1997 are now too early in their post-collegiate careers to generate meaningful estimates of the labor market effects of college characteristics.\\nas in the rest of the literature we fi nd that the effect of each college characteristic is sizeable for both cohorts in cross-sectional least squares regression models that control for variables commonly observed by researchers such as student characteristics and sat scores. however when we adjust for a proxy for unobserved student characteristics-namely by controlling for the average sat score of the colleges that students applied to-our estimates for the effects of college characteristics fall substantially and are generally indistinguishable from zero for both the 1976 and 1989\\nthe journal of human resources 326 cohort of students. notable exceptions are for racial and ethnic minorities black and hispanic students and for students whose parents have relatively little education for these subgroups our estimates remain large even in models that adjust for unobserved student characteristics. one possible explanation for this pattern of results is that highly selective colleges provide access to networks for minority students and for students from disadvantaged family backgrounds that are otherwise not available to them. finally contrary to expectations our estimates do not suggest that the effects of college characteristics within the set of c&b schools increased for students who entered college more recently because estimates for the 1976 and 1989 cohort are similar when we compare the estimates for each cohort at a similar stage relative to college entry approximately 18 to 19 years after the students entered college.\", 'f3bcd4ca-546b-4f9b-96fd-d5e4a8eaa21c': 'abstract background and purpose-though clinical cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are established risk factors for

ordering over all subjects is estimated by fitting a generalized mallows model to these approximate subject-specific orderings based on a novel probabilistic kendall's tau distance. we also introduce the concept of relative distance between events which helps in creating a disease progression timeline. subsequently we propose a method to stage subjects by placing them on the estimated disease

baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa and the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes. started in 1958 the blsa is one of the oldest continuing longitudinal studies in the united states. the design of the blsa offers two crucial attributes for distinguishing cohort from age effects. first there is a substantial range of cohorts and ages in the blsa: year of birth in this sample covers nearly a full century from 1885 to 1980 and age at assessment covers a similarly large range from 19 to 100 years old. second because of on-going recruitment efforts there is a fair amount of overlap in age across cohorts. for example the blsa includes 60-year-old participants who were born in 1920 and tested in 1980 and 60-year-old participants who were born in 1950 and tested in 2010 and many in between. thus any differences in wellbeing found across these two groups would be due to secular trends cohort time of measurement rather than age because age is invariant. the blsa however is a highly educated sample and thus effects found may not generalize to other populations. we therefore sought to replicate any effects found in the blsa with nationally representative data from nhanes. \\nmethod\\nprogram of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the united states cdc 1977. we used data from nhanes i this sample

was 45.94 sd = 13.98 range 25-74 the attrition analyses for both samples can be found in the supplementary materials.\\nin both samples well-being was assessed with a subscale of the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale radloff 1977 . this 20-item scale assesses the frequency of a variety of depressive symptoms during the previous week. items are rated on a four-point scale from 0 rarely to 3 most or all of the time. the well-being subscale is the sum of four items that measure the experience of positive emotions and well-being \"i enjoyed life.\" \"i felt that i was just as good as others.\" \"i felt hopeful about the future.\" and \"i was happy.\" that are typically reverse scored into the total scale score hertzog van alstine usala hultsch & dixon 1990 radloff 1977 . the well-being subscale was only moderately correlated with the other three subscales of the ces-d: −.30 blsa and −.22 nhanes with depressed affect −.25 blsa and −.17 nhanes with somatic complaints and −.12 blsa and nhanes with interpersonal problems. in contrast depressed affect and somatic complaints correlated .59 in the blsa and .68 in nhanes. these correlations suggested that the well-being subscale of the ces-d is related to but not the same as depression stansbury ried & velozo 2006 . at the first blsa assessment well-being had a mean of 9.88 sd = 3.05 and at the first nhanes assessment well-being had a mean of 9.20 sd = 3.27.\\nwe examined changes in well-being over time in several ways. first for comparison with previous cross-sectional studies we used linear regression to predict the first assessment of well-being from age linear term and age squared quadratic term. second to take advantage of the longitudinal data we used hierarchical linear modeling hlm raudenbush & bryk 2002 to estimate the trajectory of well-being across adulthood. using hlm version 6 raudenbush bryk & congdon 2004 we fit a quadratic model to test for non-linear changes across adulthood. we then tested sex ethnicity education year of first assessment i.e. time of measurement and year of birth i.e. cohort as level 2 predictors of the intercept and linear slope. we centered age in decades on the grand mean 65.95 years for blsa 49.20 years for nhanes to minimize the correlation between the linear and quadratic terms and facilitate interpretation. time of measurement was defined as the year of the first well-being assessment for each participant in the blsa centered on the mean year 1993. 1 year of birth was centered on the mean birth year 1935 for blsa and 1928 for nhanes. additional analyses controlled for antidepressant medication use and comorbidity in the blsa supplemental materials.\\nresults\\ncross-sectional analysis on the first assessment of well-being from each blsa participant suggested that older adults had a less positive outlook than younger and middle-aged adults in contrast to the other demographic factors adding year of birth to the model to account for differences in cohort had a dramatic effect on the estimated trajectory of well-being table  2 = .06. thus instead of a decline well-being increased across adulthood with a slight plateau in old age. antidepressant use and increased comorbidity with age had negligible effects on this trajectory.\\nto understand the effect of cohort we plotted the trajectory of five cohorts limiting the ages to the range of actual ages of assessment within each cohort  figure 1b . all five cohorts including the oldest increased slightly in well-being over time. there was however a substantial difference in the level of well-being across cohorts each younger cohort reported a more positive outlook than the previous cohort even when measured at the same age. we also examined the average level of well-being at the first assessment by decade of birth see figure 2 . each bar of the histogram represents the average level of well-being for each decade of birth independent of age. of note cohorts who lived through the great depression had progressively lower levels of well-being than those reared during more prosperous times. table 2 shows the effect of the demographic factors and secular trends on the intercept and linear slope of well-being that may explain some of the significant variability in the intercept and slope variance both ps < .01. white and educated participants generally had higher well-being. both year of first assessment and year of birth were associated with higher levels of well-being: participants who entered the study more recently year of first assessment and more recent cohorts had higher average levels of well-being. year of first assessment however did not have the same effect on the sign of the linear trajectory as did cohort the dramatic reversal of the trajectory was due to when participants were born not to when they were tested. in addition there was no effect of either cohort or year of first assessment on the slope of well-being which indicated that there was not an age x cohort or age x first assessment interaction. finally this effect of cohort was specific to well-being: after removing the well-being items from the total ces-d scale there was no effect of cohort on the slope of depressive symptoms nor the other subscales of the ces-d see supplemental material for analysis of depressed affect. table 1  analyses indicated that well-being declined with age.\\nreplicating the effect in the blsa including year of birth in the model reversed the sign of the trajectory such that well-being increased rather than decreased across adulthood although the linear slope did not reach statistical significance table 1 . replicating the pattern from the blsa with nationally representative data the well-being of those from earlier cohorts was lower than those of later cohorts  figure 3 . as with the blsa white and educated participants generally had higher levels of well-being there was no age x cohort interaction table 2  and the cohort effect was specific to well-being. \\nthe present findings suggest that cohort may be one factor that obscures the association between well-being and age. cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of two independent samples showed that well-being declined with age. the direction of this trajectory reversed however once we controlled for the fact that older cohorts started with lower levels of wellbeing. that is relative to their starting point all of the cohorts increased rather than decreased in well-being with age. although time of measurement was associated with the mean-level of well-being-those who entered the study more recently reported greater wellbeing-it did not alter the shape of the trajectory as cohort did. the present study is a step toward disentangling cohort age and time of measurement effects on well-being.\\nour analysis of cohort suggests a more positive view of happiness in old age than indicated by the cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. although participants were getting happier as they grew older the effect of age was modest about 1/10 of a standard deviation per decade in the blsa. by comparison the effect of cohort was much larger there was a greater than one standard deviation difference from the early to mid part of the 20 th century. still the effect of age was not trivial it was larger than the difference between men and women and roughly similar to the difference between a high school diploma and a college degree. thus older adults maintain and may even improve their emotional well-being despite the inevitable physical and social losses that occur with aging.\\nwhen individuals make judgments about their well-being those judgments reflect more than just an assessment of their current situation. along with factors such as personality life events and demographic characteristics the socio-cultural environment in which individuals grow up may also contribute to ratings of well-being. in the current study the well-being of those born in the early part of the 20 th century particularly those who lived through the great depression was substantially lower than cohorts who grew up during more prosperous times. such economic troubles can have devastating lasting effects. for example the psychological effects of unemployment continue even after reemployment and well-being may never return to pre-unemployment levels lucas clark georgellis & diener 2004 . similar to this individual-level effect severe economic upheaval at the national level may reduce levels of well-being a reduction that may persist even through more prosperous times. interestingly the same process does not appear to be true for depressed affect. in contrast to well-being the experience of negative emotions may reflect more dispositional and/or maturational processes that are resistant to early social and environmental influences.\\nthe cohort effect on well-being is particularly striking in the blsa sample given the generally high socioeconomic status of these participants at the time of testing. over 50% of the sample has at least a college education including the older cohorts and about 40% hold an advanced degree whereas less than 10% of the sample has less than a high school education. thus many blsa participants among the older cohorts accomplished their educational goals despite the economic upheaval of the 1930s. but even with this level of educational success the well-being of those born earlier in the 20 th century was stunted compared to those born later. this effect however was not limited to the highly educated blsa. a similar albeit less pronounced effect was apparent among the nationallyrepresentative nhanes sample suggesting a pervasive cohort effect on well-being.', 'f5cbbb74-6f6b-4f66-b86d-a6b22b8a1f45': 'abstract a study investigated the college application behaviors of students from different racial/ethnic groups whites

made significant advances in semi-supervised learning especially for classification tasks. however existing gcn based methods have two main drawbacks. first to increase the receptive field and improve the representation capability of gcns larger kernels or deeper network architectures are used which greatly increases the computational complexity and the number of parameters. second methods working on higher order graphs computed directly from adjacency matrices may alter the relationship between graph nodes particularly for weighted graphs. in addition the direct construction of higher-order graphs introduces redundant information which may result in lower network performance. to address the above weaknesses in this paper we propose a new method of multi-hop convolutional network on weighted graphs. the proposed method consists of multiple convolutional branches where each branch extracts node representation from a k-hop graph with small kernels. such design systematically aggregates multi-scale contextual information without adding redundant information. furthermore to efficiently combine the extracted information from the multihop branches an adaptive weight

dmn covariance was similar to that seen during task performance but node-to-node relationships differed from those observed during the task condition. these results suggest that disengagement of dmn

diseases. we start by showing that traditional approaches such as classification methods or greedy feature selection methods such as the fleuret method do not perform well on this problem. we then compare our information interaction method with beam and snpharvester in artificial datasets simulating epistatic interactions and show that our method is more powerful to detect pairwise epistatic interactions than its competitors. we show results of the application of information interaction method to the wtccc breast cancer dataset. our results are validated using permutation tests. we were able to find 89 statistically significant pairwise interactions with a p-value lower than 10 {3 . even though many recent algorithms have been designed to find epistasis with low marginals we observed that all except one of the snps involved in statistically significant interactions have moderate or high marginals. we also report that the interactions found in this work were not present in

coronary artery disease cad is prevalent in the general population 12 and individuals with cad are at greater risk than those who are disease free to progress to symptomatic cad and cardiac death. 1 2 early identification and preventive treatment for asymptomatic cad can potentially lower the risk for subsequent symptomatic cad. the exercise ecg remains the most commonly used screening method to detect asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. numerous studies have shown that an ischemic st-segment response to exercise is a risk factor for future coronary events in apparently healthy adults. [1] [2] [3] moreover the predictive value of exercise ecg is improved by a combined use of thallium scintigraphy. 1 4 b-mode ultrasonography allows for the noninvasive observation of age-associated normative and pathological changes in the carotid arterial structure including wall thickening 5 6 and lumen enlargement. 7 8 an association has been demonstrated between increased intimal-medial

several studies have shown a significant association of cca imt not only with cerebrovascular disease but also with clinical cad. 6 17 despite the association between increased cca imt and clinically

the hypothesis we performed exercise thallium scintigraphy in those asymptomatic subjects with positive ie ischemic exercise ecgs and compared imt in the subsets defined by the thallium results.\\nthe aim of this study was therefore to determine 1 whether cca imt is increased in asymptomatic subjects with an exercise-induced ischemic st-segment depression and 2 whether among these asymptomatic

this study presents an analysis of effectiveness of different designs of baffles including the conventional partial and oblique in limiting the manoeuvre-induced transient as well as steady-state

key words: candidate genes ⅲ genetics ⅲ ischemic stroke s troke is a multifactorial disorder or complex trait for which it is not possible to demonstrate classical patterns of inheritance. ischemic stroke is is a common neurological disease and a leading cause of severe disability and death in western countries. 1 approximately 85% to 90% of strokes are ischemic. 2 3 strong evidence from twin family and animal model studies however have consistently suggested a genetic influence on stroke risk and prognosis. 4 the genetic etiology of is is likely to be complex with many loci modulating pathophysiological processes and conferring a small to moderate risk.\\nthe most practical and widely used approach to identify common alleles influencing stroke has been candidate gene association analysis. the published genomewide association studies of is 5 6 have provided candidate loci of interest although independent replication is required to establish the most convincing of these

genotype data from 1142 women from the nurses health study and 1094 men from the prostate lung colon and ovarian cancer screening trial. blsa is a long-term study designed in 1958 to trace the effects of aging in humans. the blsa study recruited individuals aged 17 to 96 years to participate in the assessment of health and physical and psychological performance. the average length of follow-up was 7.5 years with participants evaluated every 2 years in the gerontology research center of the national institutes of health. samples from individuals that developed is alzheimer disease parkinson

http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/ϸpurcell/plink/ showed these samples not belonging to the european descent population or with a level of relatedness higher than expected. the source of the sample was also used as another covariate to correct for possible stratification.\\na stepwise series of analyses was performed. initially the outcome stroke case-control status was a function solely of snp and source of the sample baseline model. this analysis was followed by models that included age sex hypertension diabetes heart disease and smoking as covariates independent predictors. association between the investigated polymorphisms and risk of stroke were analyzed by means of logistic regression. the influence of multiple testing was evaluated using false discovery rate. all statistical analyses were done with plink.\\npower calculations were generated using a log-additive model of risk 5% type 1 error rate and 80% power. for a minor allele frequency of 0.15 the detectable or in the

under institutional review board-approved protocols at participating institutions and all subjects gave written informed consent.\\nresults\\nafter quality filtering 342 snps in 307 is cases and 324 control subjects were evaluated. each snp was tested independently for association with is. after adjustment for stroke risk factors age sex race and other stroke risk factors 7 snps were significantly associated with is risk pͻ0.05. after bonferroni correction none of these snps remained significant. because the bonferroni correction is overly conservative these 7 snps were genotyped in an independent cohort of 853 samples 583 patients with is and 270 control subjects. after adjustment for stroke risk factors none of the snps were significantly associated with is. the summary statistics associated with these 7 snps are shown in table 3 . we tested these snps for association to the main subtypes of is. after adjustment by bonferroni correction only the snp rs1799983 was

determined to have the same genetic structure.\\ntwo hundred twelve snps from 62 genes that have been reported to be significantly associated with is and were included in published meta-analyses or

snps in the candidate genes were significantly associated with is after false discovery rate correction. we also examined other snps contained in these genes or within 1 mb of these genes not reported in the literature. none of the snps were significant after correcting for multiple tests. given that samples coming from the blsa study were followed up by at least 7.5 years we can be more certain that these samples remained free of stroke. thus we further restricted these analyses to is samples and control subjects from blsa. none of the snps were significantly associated with risk for is. the

between the risk of stroke and certain snps many other studies show lack of reproducibility. in this study a series of highly plausible candidate genes were selected for intensive and comprehensive

2017\\nhttp://stroke.ahajournals.org/\\nthe potential reasons that have been discussed for this lack of reproducibility are reduced to 3 potential causes: a falsepositive association is correctly not replicated a true association fails to be replicated in an underpowered follow-up study false-negative or a true association in one population is not true in a second population because of heterogeneity in genetic or environmental background. 24 in the case of stroke most studies that have identified polymorphisms related with is are underpowered studies with a sample size not ͼ300 patients. until recently the larger-scale studies came from meta-analysis. casas et al performed meta-analyses of 120 stroke candidate gene case-control studies and a total of 51 polymorphisms in 32 genes. statistically significant associations with is were identified for factor v leiden arg506gln methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase c677t prothrombin g20210a and angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion. 15 wang et al evaluated the association between 105 polymorphisms in 64 inflammatory and cardiovascular systemrelated genes and is. none of these snps remained statistically significant after false discovery rate correction. only when the data were stratified on hypertension status 2 polymorphisms on lta were significantly associated with is in nonhypertensive subjects. the data were not adjusted for other stroke risk factors such as diabetes or heart disease. 14 other meta-analyses restricted to one or more common variant from one gene reported an association with is for gp1ba 16 or a nonassociation for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 tumor necrosis factor-␣ and itga2. 18 -20 although meta-analyses facilitate the overall interpretation of association they also need to be interpreted with caution. some meta-analyses do not include stroke risk factors as covariates and the sample sizes remain small when correctly taking into account differences in ethnicity and/or inclusion study criteria inclusion of children and adults patients with transient ischemic attack and so on. w indicates white is ischemic stroke c control subjects ch cholesterol ht

converting enzyme peptidyl-dipeptidase a 1. in an attempt to clarify these associations and avoid false-positive associations we decided to conduct a casecontrol study and used an independent cohort as a replication study of the other. in uncorrected analysis for multiple testing 7 polymorphisms were associated with is in the first stage after adjustment for stroke risk factors. none of these polymorphisms were associated with is in the replication study. in a second larger study we investigated the same genes 192 snps in common with the same results: modest albeit nonsignificant associations.\\nberger et al investigated a total of 106 snps located in 63 candidate genes for potential associations with ischemic stroke in 2 independent case-control studies from a german population. all genes tested were related to pathways important in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. only the glu298asp polymorphism in the nitric oxide synthase-3 gene was reported to be replicated in the second study. the association was independent of age sex hypertension diabetes and hypercholesterolemia in both studies. in the present study a first association with the same snp and is was not replicated in the second cohort. analysis of data of the genomewide association scan did not show an association either. only in analysis by stroke subtype using the full sample did the glu298asp polymorphism become associated with increased risk of unknown stroke subtype independent of other stroke risk factors and while using bonferroni correction. 13 the study presented here also has some limitations. the size of the studied population in the first stage using the golden gate assay is relatively small and therefore underpowered to find genes with small effects influencing risk for is. the inclusion of one second set of cases-control subjects as replication of the most significant snps rules out falsepositive associations but does not rule out the possibility of false-negative or type ii error associations. however analysis of many of these snps in a larger cohort and a review of the literature suggests that the majority of these snps have no significant effect for stroke risk in white populations.\\nthe development and application of genomewide association studies represents a significant opportunity for stroke research and provides an opportunity to test the common disease common variant hypothesis in this disorder. two genomewide association studies for stroke have been published thus far a pilot study of modest size published by us in 2007 5 that failed to find any risk alleles of large effect and a recent study published by ikram and colleagues that suggests a significant association between a locus at 12p13.33 with stroke. this locus was not present in the panel of loci selected for testing here however this locus clearly warrants replication in an independent study to confirm or refute this as an unequivocal risk factor for stroke.\\nin summary 7 polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with is after meta-analysis or replication however all of these snps have been investigated in at least one other large study in which no association with is was reported. differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria selection type of statistical evaluation covariates correction for multiple testing and inclusion of different patient populations may explain these discrepancies. this study indicates that any association that may exist is likely to be weak or perhaps restricted to specific populations or is subtypes.', 'ffee2676-a778-4521-b947-e1e420b126c5': ' predicts that tuition and fees at four-year public institutions will double in 17 years while tuition and fees at two-year publics and

a four-year degree at the average private institutions and about half a million dollars for the elite very selective institutions. only a fraction of students attends these high-priced institutions but the message taken from their pricing drives the above-the-fold news around the country if not the world. it is no wonder that students self-select themselves out of college long before they are even eligible for admissions: they don\\'t think they have a chance.\\nmost students do not understand how much college costs or how they can finance it. the high cost of college is pushing us to the tipping point or have we surpassed it? where the return on investment on higher education has diminished to the point that it may not be a prudent avenue for some prospective students. a 1999 study by the national center for education statistics nces found that only 24% of grades 6-12 parents could estimate the tuition and fee costs of college compared to just 15% of their children horn xianglei & chapman 2003 . and while 44% of middle school parents had obtained information on college or could estimate the costs only 16% of middle school students did the same.\\nto be fair understanding the labyrinth of higher education is a challenge for all regardless of income or background. the equivocal and contradictory reports in the news do not make this information much clearer. just recently the new york times published a report about college still being worth it leonhardt 2014  while the chronicle of higher education showcased the lack of gainful employment of recent graduates supiano 2014 . the challenge is that many students self-select themselves out of the college pipeline because they either do not believe they can afford it do not feel they are prepared for it or worse simply feel they do not belong there hoxby & turner 2014 swail cabrera & lee 2004 . as laura rendon once wrote college dropout begins to happen in grade school rendon 1997 .\\nregardless of these heavy financial burdens on college students i believe the true primary reason that students do not prepare apply admit and succeed in higher education is academic wherewithal. students who take rigorous coursework are much more likely to finish a bachelor\\'s degrees than others regardless of ancillary issues such as financial need adelman 1997 . the rigorous course work in effect serves as a proxy for other important criterion such as study skills time management and organizational skills burrus jackson holtzman roberts & mandigo 2013 kerka 2007 . students need to know \"how\" to learn and how to manage their time. they must develop higher order thinking skills and be able to work in isolation and in groups. while many students drop out because of finances much more dropout because they just don\\'t have the academic-related skill-sets to succeed.\\nthe challenges facing higher education institutions especially open admissions institutions is daunting. the deficiencies in student preparation and learning can be broad and vast. the idea that institutions can essentially fix 13 years of schooling through one bridge program one semester of freshman 101 or one supplemental course is mindblowing.\\nremediation is an example of a concern for students and retention specialists. data from the nces illustrate that 21% of first-year undergraduates attending public four-year institutions and 24% at two-year public institutions 2007-08 enrolled in at least one remedial course sparks & malkus 2013  and the percentages increase for non-white students ross et al. 2012 . the variation in remedial enrollment between open admissions and very selective admissions institutions is also large: 13% vs. 26%. remediation does impact graduation rates. nces data suggest an 8% graduation gap between remedial vs. non-remedial students at four-year public institutions 53% vs. 61%.\\n1 1 this analysis is by the author using the nces quickstats data tool. analysis considered first time beginning postsecondary students bps in 2003-04 at a four-year public institution who either did not enroll in a remedial course their freshman year by the six-year graduation rate in 2009. interesting note: other non-profit organizations have suggested a much larger gap in performance between remedial students and non-remedial students e..g 58% vs. 17% as reported by the complete college america. however the author was unable to substantiate these claims by any viable method and their source work was incomplete.\\nthe articles presented in this special issue of higher learning research communications discuss important issues such as prediction of dropout frameworks for retaining students and various strategies for addressing attrition such as counseling service learning and academic support services. given my thesis above it is not to suggest that remediation study skill training and time management and many of the other strategies implored in this volume are not of utility. they clearly are. however the philosophical question remains about how much we do for whom?\\nmy prior research illustrated with use of beginning postsecondary student bps data from the nces that students who have these attributes are much less likely to graduate from college:\\n\\uf09f attend part-time \\uf09f have a low gpa \\uf09f are of non-traditional age e.g. older \\uf09f are non-white with the exception of asian \\uf09f are first generation \\uf09f are low income and/or independent \\uf09f have a variety of risk factors including having children being single \\uf09f delay entry to college \\uf09f attend an hbcu or hsi \\uf09f have lower levels of high school mathematics \\uf09f attend more than one institution although this can depend and \\uf09f work more than 20 hours a week.\\nthere are more. but these examples get at the crux of the issues that help determine whether a student will sink or swim in higher education. some students have many of these attributes. some only one or a few. the chart below illustrates that 66% of first time college students end up attaining a degree within six years compared to 44% of students with at least one risk factor.\\n2 those with multiple risk factors have a much lower change of postsecondary success. only 34% of those with two or three risk factors and 30% of those with four or more graduated with a degree within 6 years.\\n2 risk factors in this analysis of bps data include: part-time enrollment delaying entry into postsecondary education after high school not having a regular high school diploma having children being a single parent being financially independent of parents working full time while enrolled. w. s. swail in the end none of these should be used to deny access to college for an individual. that stated somewhere along the continuum there is a line where students will not succeed. a line beyond where no matter what we do in higher education we cannot fix the source challenges that face a particular student. the question is whether we want to know where that line is. with regard to public policy and public perception it seems clear that no one currently wants to find that line. we seem completely content with the status quo and not dealing with the hard and difficult issue of drawing a line.\\nthe reality is that our open system of education is costly. with regard to remediation alone estimates suggest that the cost of current remediation practices is in the area of $3.6 billion alliance for excellent education 2011. i\\'ve alluded to the growing costs of higher education especially with regard to the prices paid by students and parents. are we at the tipping point of college opportunity?\\nin the end what does this all mean? given this somewhat dreadful information i have showcased and beyond the policy implications that are handed down from states and the federal government upon which an institution has little or no control what does an institution do about student access and success?\\nfor starters i believe the first rule of conduct for an institution is to define for themselves what success looks like and how that success is manifested in a student or cohort at their institution. it is critically important for institutions to understand the nature of success not just from an academic perspective but from a social non-cognitive perspective. in the end what is it that makes students success at college xyz? every institution can run internal multiple regression analyses to provide details on the attributes of graduates compared to dropouts and transfers. academic data on progress can be merged with social data from institutional surveys to provide such information as study habits use of time work comfortability and yes even happiness to see how those link with academic outcomes. this information can be used in several ways. first it can be used to help instructional faculty better understand their students. second instructors should have some diagnostic tool to gauge when a student is having academic or other challenges. third academic advisors and counselors should absolutely use these data to help describe to freshman students what success looks like. in the workshops that i conduct i suggest that advisors have prepared a one-page sheet to give to their students that lists that student\\'s various academic and non-academic scores/preferences/habits from institutional surveys in one column compared with data of successful students from their college in a second column. success should be visual and put in perspective. i think it is of great merit to illustrate to a student that if they study x hours per week use y institutional support services and work with their friends and peers that they too can succeed. students need roadmaps. give them one.\\nthe second rule of conduct is to be real about admissions. when an institution accepts the registration of a student they are in effect entering a moral ethical and legal contract with the student to do whatever they can to help that student succeed. they need to ensure that the student gets the support he or she needs which means that the institution must have insight into those needs early and often. conversely if the institution is not able willing or interested in doing so then they should do the right thing and not admit that student. this sounds harsh but i see this play out countless times at institutions. after the student is admitted many aspects of the institution besides basic instruction are provided in a distant noninvasive manner when they should be both intrusive and invasive. in this data age it is relatively easy for the institution to diagnose the positives and negatives of a student at day 1. it is up to the institution to identify these issues and provide assistance and not simply expect that students will find assistance on their own. at-risk students who often are first generation and low-income are typically the last people to ask for help. institutions can\\'t just \"phone in\" this type of support. they have to meet students where they are.\\nif you travel the similar circles as me it is rare when i meet someone working at an institution who does not want their students to succeed. but sometimes we do some things that hinder rather than help students. part of student success may be steering students away from your institution or department. if he or she does not belong there do not enroll them do not take their money and do not burden them with loans that can never pay off. or just as bad or worse the growing burden being placed on parents who are taking out plus loans or remortgaging their house to pay for college.\\nperhaps one of the most immoral things we can do is to admit a student who seriously does not have the skills to stay in the game. back to my original thesis i do not agree with those that say that all students can learn and succeed in college and we should admit anyone who wants that opportunity. we should not. in consideration of the both financial and opportunity costs we should be more mindful of the moral authority of accepting students who are not likely to succeed. statistically most students who apply to college can succeed. but there is also a large group of students that are ill-prepared to succeed at this level. some students are not effectively motivated to do the work they need to do. some just do not have the requisite skills to take on the \"higher\" learning. in many cases these issues weren\\'t their fault. they are simply outcomes of a system that poorly prepared them for postsecondary education and in many cases the world of work. but nonetheless here they are at our doorstep. society has told them that success is difficult without a college degree. this too is an injustice but that is the message we send daily to students. just because they show up does not mean we can encourage and support them to finish. for some level of student success we do better by steering them to achieve their goals somewhere else. somewhere cheaper somewhere more appropriate to their interests. but not here.\\nwe are fortunate to be served by a fairly well-articulated system of higher education. however we have not been similarly well served by the infighting of our tiers. to be fair we created this problem by forcing the community colleges and universities to vie competitively for public funding separately so it should not be that shocking that this evolved into an us vs. them dialogue. instead of playing a game of one-upmanship we are better served by harnessing our system and using it in series much the way the original california master plan envisioned the articulation between their community colleges and two university levels. yes there are clearly equity issues involved in this but we can\\'t talk about all issues in this one very small very trivial article.\\nin fact we may be able to serve our at-risk youth better in community colleges that teach better in many ways than in universities. in 2001 the tennessee higher education commission moved its remedial coursework to the community college in order to save money but also to keep higher education for \"higher education\" and by 2012 22 states had either eliminated funding or made other moves to relegate remedial class work to the community college system huse wright clark & hacker 2005 pant 2012 . some saw this as a knock against college access. in reality it makes much more sense to let students who are on the academic cusp experiment at a much lower cost afforded by community colleges institutions that are often in their own communities that also reduce the extra costs associated with room and board. virginia for example guarantees transfer to all state institutions including the flagship university of virginia virginia tech and the college of william & mary to students who complete an associate\\'s degree at a specified academic level. this gives more breathing room to students and also significantly reduces their costs during the first two years of their articulated four-year program. in the end these students graduate with the parchment of the university.\\nultimately we need to decide on a policy basis who we want to go to college who we want to succeed and who will pay for it. without delving more into the much-discussed issue of college costs the amount carried by students and parents will continue to grow as will the costs borne by states. the costs associated with sending more students to college is not trivial for our society. another paper can discuss the philosophy of education and these other important questions. but for the institution it is critical to understand student success and what to do about it. it isn\\'t about saving all students but it is about changing the culture of an institution to do what can be done to all students that are admitted. if they come they should be served with the highest regard for the highest reward.'}\n",

this situation. nineteen hospitalized older patients mean age 83 years with c-reactive protein crp level >20mg/l were recruited. ree and tee were measured using gold standard methods of indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water dlw respectively. ree was then compared to data from a previous study on aged volunteers from nursing homes who were free of an acute stressor event. energy requirements measured by dlw were confirmed at 1.3 × ree. energy intake covered the needs but did not prevent weight loss in these patients. tee was not increased in hospitalized patients and was not

relationships between prenatal growth birth weight and adult muscle mass 13 23 42 and grip strength 27 50 and have shown midlife strength to be a predictor of mortality 45. despite these relationships

predisposed to potentially debilitating losses in muscle mass and strength with advancing age 27. therefore there is a need to examine the potential influence of igf2 polymorphism on muscle mass and

socioeconomic consequences of these early work experiences are a matter of considerable debate see staff mortimer and uggen 2004 for a review. early on greenberger and steinberg 1986 see also steinberg and cauffman 1995warned that teenage investment in paid work poses \"opportunity costs\" to longer-term attainment by disrupting school performance and promoting problem behaviors that jeopardize achievement. a plausible alternative hypothesis is that paid work in adolescence fosters longer-term socioeconomic attainment by promoting skill development providing on-the-job training and by building good work habits dependability and responsibility stern and nakata 1989 ruhm 1997 .\\nwhereas previous studies indicate both positive and negative consequences of employment there is growing consensus that the amount of investment in paid work is what determines its positive or negative influence. that is limited involvement in paid work during adolescence is found to promote socioeconomic attainment while excessive involvement in early work is detrimental. for example youths who work intensively an average of more than 20 hours per week report fewer hours of homework lower grade point averages and standardized test scores and a greater likelihood of high school dropout than youths who do not work or limit their hours lee and staff 2007 marsh and kleitman 2005

socioeconomic achievement.\\npartly because teenagers typically devote substantial time to passive leisure activities larson and verma 1999 moderate work hours or an average of 20 hours or less per week do not limit time for homework and extracurricular activities shanahan and flaherty 2001 schoenhals tienda and schneider 1998 . work of moderate intensity is found to be associated with increased

moderate work hours over the duration of high school also increases the likelihood of obtaining a 4-year college degree especially for youth who display limited educational promise at the onset of high school mortimer 2003 staff and mortimer 2007 .\\na third hypothesis related to the impacts of teenage employment is that preexisting individual differences in school performance aspirations socioeconomic background and unmeasured variables such as ability and motivation explain the patterns described above. for instance youth from low socioeconomic backgrounds tend on average to work more hours when they are employed than their more advantaged peers entwisle alexander and olson 2000 mortimer staff oesterle 2003. moreover poorly performing students with low educational aspirations have greater workforce involvement in subsequent years of high school than their better performing peers bachman and schulenberg 1993 bachman safron sy and schulenberg 2003.\\nstudies using data from the national education longitudinal study nels:88 found little evidence of a relationship between paid work hours and school performance once prior differences between individuals are taken into account schoenhals tienda and schneider 1997 warren lepore and mare 2001 but see marsh and kleitman 2005. likewise using data from the 1979 national longitudinal survey of youth hotz xu tienda and ahituv 2002 found that the effect of prior work experience on the wages of young men diminished to statistical nonsignificance once they controlled for unmeasured traits such as ability or motivation. hotz and colleagues compared high school workers to non-workers not intensive workers to other workers.\\nin sum longitudinal research supports to some extent the idea that intensive investment in paid work during adolescence has adverse effects on the process of socioeconomic attainment during the transition to adulthood.\\nhowever because the decisions about whether to hold a job during the school year as well as about how many hours to work are affected by the young persons\" socioeconomic background school achievement and educational expectations it is important to consider whether the adverse effects of intensive work hours on longer-term achievement are conditioned by these preexisting individual characteristics. in particular there is evidence that heavy investment in paid work during adolescence may not be harmful for those youth who come from more disadvantaged backgrounds. for young economically disadvantaged males paid work actually increased their chances of high school completion entwisle alexander and olson 2005. analyses of summer employment programs report similar benefits of employment for the school enrollment of youth in low-income households farkas olsen and stromsdorfer 1981 farkas smith and stromsdorfer 1983. in the next section we consider several reasons why socioeconomic origins may condition the effects of teenage work hours on subsequent achievement during the transition to adulthood.\\nsome scholars have suggested that long work hours may not be harmful and may even be beneficial to the longer-term attainment of youth who come from whereas intensive work hours during high school have been found to increase wages and the likelihood of employability in the years immediately following high school meyer and wise 1982 mortimer and finch 1986 stern and nakata 1989 and in young adulthood carr wright and brody 1996 ruhm 1997  it is possible that disadvantaged youth especially benefit longterm from early work experiences. employment may provide disadvantaged youth an alternative source of human capital acquisition especially if they face limited prospects for post-secondary schooling. among a sample of mostly lower ses youths in baltimore early work involvement increased the skill level of the occupation held in later adolescence entwisle alexander and olson 2000. in a sample of delinquent teenagers in new york paid work during early adolescence led to higher quality employment in subsequent years sullivan 1989. together these studies suggest that early work experiences are an integral part of the process of socioeconomic attainment for youth from low socioeconomic backgrounds.\\nto address these issues we draw on data from the youth development study the respondents\" parents were also surveyed in the first year of the study to obtain accurate information about socioeconomic status and other family background characteristics 95% of all mothers and 90% of all fathers who resided with yds participants completed surveys. in the 13 years following high school respondents completed up to eleven follow-up surveys at ages 19 20 21 22 24 25 26 27 29 30 and 31. approximately 76 percent of respondents have been retained during the most recent waves of survey collection. panel retention in the later years of the study is not associated with numerous indicators of socioeconomic background mental health delinquency family structure extracurricular involvement and educational promise although males non-whites and youth who resided in households where no family members were employed during the prior year 1987 have a higher risk of survey attrition than females whites and those youth who resided in families where at least one family member was employed staff and mortimer 2007 .\\nteenage work investments. we use a series of dummy variables to capture high school work patterns in grades 10 through 12. based on continuous work histories during these three years the measures reflect employment duration five distinct patterns of work investment were identified: the \"mostinvested\" workers high on both duration and intensity dimensions \"sporadic\" workers low duration and high intensity \"occasional\" workers low on both \"steady\" workers high duration and low intensity and nonworkers throughout high school. the \"most invested\" \"steady\" and \"occasional\" workers each constitute about a quarter of the panel. the \"sporadic\" workers make up about 17 percent while testifying to the ubiquity of the practice of combining the high school student and worker roles non-workers constitute only about 6 percent of the total panel.\\nwage attainments. during each survey year following the scheduled date of high school graduation respondents reported their hourly wages in their current jobs. we adjusted the hourly wage rate to the value of a dollar in 1991. to minimize the influence of outliers we deleted a small number of cases less than 1 percent each year when respondents reported earning more than 5 times the median wage. in cases where a respondent was employed in a full-time and part-time job we considered only the wages of the full-time job.\\neducational attainment. educational attainment is indicated by the receipt of a bachelor\"s degree or higher. we preferred this educational threshold because of its salience to youth and their parents and because there is no widespread recognition of intermediate degrees e.g. associates\\ndegrees in the labor market kerckhoff 2003.\\nbackground factors. information about socioeconomic status and other family background characteristics was obtained from mothers and fathers who were surveyed by mail in the first year of the study. we measured the highest educational credential of the mother or father ranging on a nine-point scale from less than a high school degree to a ph.d. or professional degree. we also measured total family income ranging on a ten-point scale from $5000 to $100000. school performance and educational aspirations were also measured during the 9 th grade. grade point average is coded on a 12-point scale ranging from \"f\" to \"a.\" educational aspirations are measured on a six-point scale ranging from less than a high school degree to a ph.d. or professional degree.\\nprecursors of teenage work. we first distinguish the five teenage work categories in terms of socioeconomic background and educational promise. the advantage of continuous work investments during the high school years for youth of lower social class backgrounds with respect to longer-term wage attainments is also shown in table 1 . in fact low ses youth who followed a pattern of intensive and continuous work during high school reported relatively high hourly wages at age 19 exceeded only by the small group of non-workers. by age 31 however the early returns of heavy work investment during adolescence had faded. since the steady workers had had time to complete their educations and begin to accumulate full-time work experience it is not surprising that by age 31 they reported the highest hourly wages.\\namong low ses youth the median wages at age 31 of steady workers is approximately 9% to 13% higher than among those youth who followed a sporadic or occasional work pattern.\\ntable 1 also shows that steady work during high school benefited the longer-term wages of youth from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds though the differences in adult wages among the steady workers and the other work categories are considerably smaller in magnitude. it is plausible to expect that the economic returns to the higher educational attainments of the steady workers especially in comparison to the sporadic and most-invested workers will be increasingly apparent as the years progress.\\nit is apparent that young people pursue different \"tracks\" with varying emphases upon school and work which commence as early as age 14 and 15 and continue as they move through adolescence and the transition to adulthood.\\nyouth who come from more advantaged backgrounds and who are more strongly oriented toward schooling are more likely than their less advantaged counterparts to pursue steady work high duration low intensity during high school and they invest more in postsecondary education especially in 4 in previous research we showed that employment patterns during the high school years establish strategies of time management that persist through the period of post-secondary schooling and influence higher educational attainment. staff and mortimer 2007 found continuity in employment patterns as the steady work pattern during high school is followed by extensive part-time work combined with schooling while the most-invested work pattern precedes heavier involvement in the full-time labor force.\\ndespite the clear association between work involvement during high school and educational attainment in young adulthood table 1  multivariate analyses\\nshowed that the inclusion of subsequent work patterns in this key period of post-secondary educational investment renders the effect of the steady high school work pattern on 4-year degree attainment statistically nonsignificant. in particular the inclusion of accumulated months of postsecondary \"school and part-time work\" mediates the benefits of the steady high school work pattern on subsequent receipt of a bachelor\"s degree. this shows that the educational advantage of steady workers accrues from a continuous pattern of combining school with low-intensity work a strategy that serves them well throughout high school during postsecondary schooling and during their early occupational careers.\\nin conclusion early employment experiences appear to be an integral part of human capital acquisition during the transition to adulthood especially in the context of the unstructured school-to-work transition regime characteristic of the united states. in years past young people typically made a sequential transition from full-time school to full-time work a transition that could be characterized as a discrete event. we contend that two ideal typical routes characterize the more prolonged school-to-work transition among contemporary cohorts of young people. one route involves less intensive employment during high school followed by continued part-time employment and post-secondary educational investment most likely in fouryear colleges. this pathway is more common for youth of higher socioeconomic origins but is especially beneficial for young people from lower ses backgrounds. a second route involves early intensive work experience during high school that is less conducive to higher educational attainment.\\nsporadic and highly invested workers are less likely to achieve 4-year degrees irrespective of their parents\" educational backgrounds. by age 31 these workers are beginning to show lower hourly wage rates than youth who worked less intensively in adolescence and were more likely to pursue postsecondary schooling in the years immediately following high school.\\nthis study demonstrates the power of socioeconomic background in determining the educational attainment of youth. this finding is not new as parents\" education is a foremost indicator of family social class background whose influence on educational attainment has been confirmed by many studies in the status attainment tradition see for example sewell haller and portes 1969 sewell and hauser. 1975 . what is new here is the important role of high school work patterns in understanding higher educational achievement and wage attainments of young people from both high and low socioeconomic origins. steady workers are the most likely to achieve ba/bs degrees in both socioeconomic groups. they also had the highest hourly wage rates in adulthood. those whose parents are well-educated thus have a double\\nadvantage-of high family resources and an early experience of balancing school and work that is conducive to a \"well-rounded\" teenage life style shanahan and flaherty 2001 and to eventual educational achievement. but interestingly even a high social class background is not enough to counteract the detrimental effects of highly intensive high school work sporadic and most invested work patterns. steady workers of low socioeconomic origins are especially likely to achieve ba degrees and come to overtake in hourly wage rates their counterparts who pursued the \"most invested\" work during high school.\\nwhereas ses background has a strong impact on the character of high school work patterns some youth march to a different drummer. those who do-steady high school workers from backgrounds indicating low educational promise are especially advantaged in contrast intensive high school workers from advantaged family backgrounds appear to suffer considerable disadvantage in socioeconomic attainment.\\nwe offer these findings in the hope that scholars who are interested in processes of vocational development career establishment and ', '084bc080-448e-4e70-a910-836787f73e09': 'abstract objectives. to evaluate personality

allow estimation of an undistorted volume. alternatively additional field maps acquisitions can be used along with sequence information to determine warping fields. however not all imaging protocols include these additional scans and cannot take advantage of state-of-the art distortion correction. to avoid additional acquisitions structural mri undistorted scans can be used as registration targets for intensity driven correction. in this study we aim to 1 enable susceptibility distortion correction with historical and/or limited diffusion datasets that do not include specific sequences

such data. there are situations in which the parameters of the model are subject to some restrictions or constraints. for example in hearing loss studies we expect hearing to deteriorate with time.

wide range of studies with different designs study populations and results has fueled uncertainty about the best way to use psav and confused the issue of its utility in the early detection setting. studies of disease prognosis suggest that psav is strongly associated with lethal cancers. however prospective screening trials find that psav is at best a weak predictor of high-risk disease. in this commentary we synthesize and reconcile the evidence about the value of psav in the early detection setting. we review recent studies of psav and determine a set of statistical considerations that we believe to be critical in study evaluation and interpretation. we explain why the association between psav and disease-specific survival does not necessarily imply that psav will be a useful screening tool. in addition we argue that the standard concept of psav -the absolute change in psa per year -confuses disease aggressiveness with the interval from disease onset to detection. we therefore recommend that other methods be explored to incorporate information about psa kinetics that could ultimately improveand even transform -how we detect and treat prostate cancer.',

actn3 has been associated with elite athletic performance and recently with differences in isometric and dynamic muscle strength and power in the general population. in this study we sought to determine the association of actn3 r577x genotype with muscle strength and mass phenotypes in men and women across the adult age span. eight hundred forty-eight n ϭ 848 adult volunteers 454 men and 394 women aged 22-90 yr were genotyped for actn3 r577x. knee extensor ke shortening and lengthening peak torque values were determined using isokinetic dynamometry and fat-free mass ffm by dual-energy

muscle strength sex differences skeletal muscle the ␣-actinins comprise a family of actin-binding proteins two of which play an important structural role in skeletal muscle: ␣-actinin-2 and ␣-actinin-3 27. ␣-actinin-3 is a structural protein of the sarcomeric z-line that is only expressed in type ii muscle fibers 19 and is known to be important for anchoring actin and playing a regulatory function in coordinating muscle fiber contraction 1. the ␣-actinin-3 protein is absent in ϳ18% of healthy individuals of european descent with homozygosity of a common premature stop codon at the r577x polymorphism rs1815739 c3 t transition at position 1747 in exon 16 in the actn3 gene 20. the ␣-actinins have been shown to be highly conserved and recent evidence has suggested that loss of actn3 gene function shows positive selection in humans 13. the actn3 r577x genotype has been associated with elite athletic performance 6 17 21 34  and recently our laboratory observed that the actn3 r577x nonsense allele is underrepresented in elite-level strength athletes 24 providing further evidence that the absence of the ␣-actinin-3 protein impairs skeletal muscle force production. some studies also indicate the possibility of an advantage for x/x homozygotes in endurance-type activities 17 34 and recent work in rodents supports these initial findings 2 12 13.\\nthe role of the actn3 r577x polymorphism in normal variation in muscle function in nonathletes has not been clearly established. clarkson and colleagues 3 demonstrated that women homozygous for the actn3 577x allele had lower baseline isometric strength compared with heterozygotes when adjusted for body mass and age but unexpectedly demonstrated greater responses to strength training. moran et al. 16 observed significantly lower 40-m sprint times in an unselected group of adolescent male x/x homozygotes but found that the r577x polymorphism was not associated with other power phenotypes. vincent and colleagues 30 demonstrated greater dynamic muscle strength and a higher proportion of type iix fibers in r/r compared with x/x men. in contrast our laboratory group 4 has observed unexpected results regarding actn3 genotype influences on muscle power in a group of elderly women. we demonstrated that peak power in these older women at baseline was significantly greater in x/x women than both r/x and r/r women although after a 10-wk strength training program consistent with our hypothesis relative peak power change with strength training in the r/r group was higher than the x/x homozygotes 4. in addition although preliminary work by san juan et al. 25 observed that complete deficiency of ␣-actinin-3 does not effect maximal muscle strength in elderly women. most recently delmonico et al. 5 observed that over a 5-yr period women deficient in ␣-actinin-3 displayed a significantly greater risk of developing lower extremity limitation with age compared with r/r homozygotes.\\nalthough associations of actn3 r577x with performance have been clearly observed in elite-level athletes studies involving nonathletes have provided more mixed results therefore we set out to examine the actn3 r577x polymorphism in a nonathlete population aged across the lifespan. given the localization of ␣-actinin-3 in fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers and the importance of such fibers for force-generating capacity we hypothesized that individuals deficient in ␣-actinin-3 xallele homozygotes would display lower levels of muscle strength compared with r/x ϩ r/r individuals with the

brain extraction algorithm that incorporates elastic registration tissue segmentation and morphological techniques which are combined by a watershed principle while paying special attention to the preservation of the boundary between the gray matter and the cerebrospinal fluid. the approach was evaluated by comparison to a manual rater and compared to several other leading algorithms on a publically available data set of brain images using the dice coefficient and containment index as performance metrics. the qualitative and quantitative impact of this initial step on subsequent cortical surface generation is also presented. our experiments demonstrate that our approach is quantitatively better than six other leading algorithms with statistical significance on modern

led to an increase in the dimensionality of the data collected to investigate biological questions. in this context dimension-reduction techniques can be used to summarize high-dimensional signals into low-dimensional ones to further test for association with one or more covariates of interest. this paper revisits one such approach previously known as principal component of heritability and

explained by one or several covariates of interest. by construction this method optimises power but limited by its computational complexity it has unfortunately received little attention in the past. here we propose a general analytical pcev framework that builds on the assets of the original method i.e. conceptually simple and free of tuning parameters. moreover our framework extends the range of applications of the original procedure by providing a computationally simple strategy for high-dimensional outcomes along with exact and asymptotic testing procedures that drastically reduce its computational cost. we investigate the merits of the pcev using an extensive set of simulations. furthermore the use of the pcev approach will be illustrated using three examples taken from the

recent national reports indicate that substantial inequality in achievement remains. these inequalities can temper one's optimism about the degree to which the united states has made real progress

demanding high school math classes such as precalculus and calculus. the authors explore the roles of family socioeconomic status and school composition in explaining this pattern. findings suggest that among those students reaching the advanced math high school stratum hispanic youth from lowincome families and african american youth from segregated schools fare the worst in terms of closing the achievement gap with their white peers. the authors discuss potential explanations for the achievement differences observed and stress the need for more research that focuses explicitly on the

neighborhoods negatively affect academic outcomes ðcrane 1991 harding 2003 south baumer and lutz 2003þ . for example coleman and colleagues in their seminal equality of educational opportunity report argued that peer effects were strong predictors of academic achievement: \"the social composition of the student body is more highly related to achievement independent of the student\\'s own social background than is any other school factor\" ðcoleman et al. 1966 p. 325þ. social science evidence on contextual effects has informed social science theory and educational policy in the united states which for the past four decades has sought to mix students by racial background and more recently by poverty status the scholarly consensus on contextual effects however rests largely on cross-sectional studies which do not provide a strong basis for causal inference. selection bias perhaps the most important threat to the validity of point-in-time studies can give rise to what hauser ð1970þ termed the \"contextual fallacy\": \"the contextual method rests on the arbitrary identification of residual group differences in the dependent variable with correlated aspects of group composition on an independent variable. . . . the only way to eliminate such correlations is to assign individuals randomly to groups and this is impossible with observational data\" ðp. sanbonmatsu et al. 2006 kling liebman and katz 2007þ . some of this recent work raises important questions about whether causal inferences about contextual effects are warranted ðmouw 2006þ. finally very few longitudinal contextual effects studies account for time-dependent confounding. time-dependent confounders which predict both future treatment and future outcome conditional on past treatment present a challenge to estimating unbiased treatment effects. for example in estimating the effect of poverty context on child outcomes one may wish to control for intermediate outcomes such as educational experiences while in school ðsuch as assignment to gifted or remedial programs or being retained in a gradeþ. if these intermediate outcomes then predict both future treatment and future outcome standard methods-controlling for these factors omitting them or controlling for baseline values-can produce biased estimates ðrobins hernán and brumback 2000 hong and raudenbush 2008þ . methods for addressing treatment effect bias from time-dependent confounding have been developed in epidemiology by robins and colleagues ðrobins 1999 hernán brumback and robins 2000 robins et al. 2000 cole and hernán 2008þ . recent work using these methods has demonstrated negative effects of exposure to neighborhood concentrated disadvantage on verbal ability ðsampson sharkey and raudenbush 2008þ. this study uses longitudinal data to estimate the effect of exposure to a high-poverty classroom on elementary and middle school students\\' test scores. these data include interval metric and vertically equated mathematics and reading test scores and variation across time in classroom-level poverty from a complete cohort of public school children in grades 3-8 in the state of north carolina from 2001 to 2006 ðmore than 500000 studentyear observationsþ. the study contributes to contextual effects research by carefully specifying and accounting for bias from omitted and mismeasured time-invariant student and family background characteristics. we report effects of classroom poverty based on three measures: attendance in a high-poverty classroom ði.e. one in the top quartile of the classroom poverty distributionþ cumulative exposure to a high-poverty classroom and continuous classroom poverty. we first present cross-sectional multilevel estimates of the association between classroom poverty and math test score. these estimates reproduce the negative effects reported in previous research with cross-sectional designs. the strength of the cross-sectional association increases with grade level. by eighth grade these estimates are particularly large which suggests that the cognitive disadvantage of classroom poverty exposure appears to accumulate over time. growth models produce very small negative effects on two of the three measures ðhigh-poverty classroom and continuous classroom povertyþ and larger negative effects on the other ðcumulative exposure to a high-poverty classroomþ. to address endogenous self-selection based on fixed unobservables we present student fixed-effects estimates which remove between-student confounding ðallison 2009þ. this approach controls for time-invariant unmeasured and mismeasured aspects of student and family background that may predict both family choice of neighborhood and school and test score achievement. these models produce estimates distinguishable from zero but of negligible size. we also estimate marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weighting to address time-dependent confounding ðrobins et al. hong and raudenbush 2008þ . these models produce nonsignificant effects on math and very small effects of classroom poverty on reading which suggests that our estimates are robust to two different threats to validity.\\nthe effects reported do not suggest that all children\\'s life course outcomes are insensitive to classroom poverty but they raise important doubts about the causal status of the effect of classroom poverty on student test scores among children and young adolescents an implication that we discuss in our conclusion.', '2d858fc7-3c56-47de-94fc-b156c53afb55': 'abstract public

the effects of natural structure on the probabilities of storm surges shows that several different types of spatial- temporal- and process-related organizations affect key assumptions made in many of the methods used to estimate these probabilities. following a brief introduction to general historical methods we analyze the two joint probability methods used in most tropical cyclone hazard and risk studies today: the surface response function and bayesian quadrature. a major difference between these two methods is that the response function creates continuous surfaces which can be interpolated or extrapolated on a fine scale if necessary and the bayesian quadrature optimizes a set of probability masses which cannot be directly interpolated or extrapolated. several examples are given here showing significant impacts related to natural structure that should not be neglected in hazard and risk assessment for tropical cyclones including: 1 differences between omnidirectional sampling and directional-dependent sampling of storms in near coastal areas 2 the impact of surge probability discontinuities on the treatment of epistemic uncertainty 3 the ability to reduce aleatory

and related coursework plans i.e. number of courses in different academic domains for high school and college. specifically this study focuses on academically advanced students because they are most likely to achieve the highest levels of career accomplishment and their patterns of career choice have paralleled those of the general population albeit at more professional levels gross 2006 lubinski & benbow 2006 terman & oden 1947 . academically advanced students for purposes of this study are those who have earned scores on standardized assessments of achievement and aptitude that are at least one standard deviation above the mean and/or have grades and teacher recommendations that suggest that their performance in one or more academic disciplines is beyond that of their classmates of the same age.\\naccording to gottfredson 1981  an individual\\'s career choice is multidetermined. in childhood individuals eliminate career choices based on sex stereotypes and they further narrow their occupational choices in adolescence by considering their interests and abilities. in addition holland\\'s theory of career development posits that individuals make career choices mainly along lines of occupational stereotyping osipow 1983 . that is individuals\\' career plans are informed at least in part by their perceptions of what types of jobs are appropriate for them. taken together these theories support stereotyping as a factor affecting the career choices that people make. as an example mckenna and ferrero 1991 found boys\\' and girls\\' attitudes toward careers were strongly sex-typed. boys and girls stated they preferred jobs that were traditional for their sex with boys in particular viewing nontraditionally male occupations less favorably than tradition- ally male ones. similarly a study of high school students\\' career plans conklin 2000 revealed the following trends: female students overwhelmingly chose health 76% who chose this profession were female education 83% female and social/human service 82% female professions. on the other hand male students chose professions such as computer science 83% male engineering 86% male and manufacturing 87% male.\\nrecent research points to implicit and explicit sex stereotypes in the work force specifically engineering and accounting are conceptualized as \"masculine\" careers and elementary education is conceptualized as a \"feminine\" career white & white 2006 . as another example a recent comprehensive review of the research on sex differences in math and science among both average and high-ability individuals showed evidence that children conceptualize mathematics as a \"masculine\" activity halpern et al. 2007 .\\nresearch suggests sex stereotyping begins in childhood influencing

analyzing sex differences in writing attitudes and achievement pajares and valiante 2001 found middle school girls had higher perceptions of their writing ability self-identified with being a writer placed a higher value on the importance of writing and had higher writing grades than boys. these findings are consistent with the stereotype that girls have stronger verbal abilities than boys. if boys do not identify males as having strong verbal abilities they may have lower perceptions of their own ability in that area such a stereotype can limit boys\\' perceptions of their writing ability and their performance. a recent review of literature on women in computer-related majors revealed that college women had lower perceptions of their abilities in computer science than men despite no differences in ability and showed little interest in the field singh et al. 2007 . the authors stated that their \"[f ]indings present a complex interplay of social and personal reasons for why fewer women than men choose computer careers\" singh et al. 2007 p. 510 . further ji and colleagues 2004 found when male and female eighth-grade students perceived occupations as employing more members of their own sex they also expressed more interest and higher perceptions of ability in those occupations.\\nthe extant literature indicates sex stereotypes also are related to students\\' course choices riegle-crumb farkas & muller 2006 whitehead 1996 . whitehead 1996 examined course planning among a-level students students in britain who enroll in rigorous coursework similar to advanced placement in the united states. the study showed a-level boys believed more strongly in sex stereotypes than did their female peers and this belief related to their course choices more than it did for girls. based on students\\' perceptions of whether boys or girls were better at certain courses whitehead 1996 identified courses as either masculine 66% or more of students perceived boys to be better at the course feminine 66% or more of the students perceived girls to be better or gender-neutral 66% or more of students perceived boys and girls to be equally skilled. the courses perceived as masculine made up 63% of boys\\' advanced course choices and courses perceived as feminine made up only 2% of boys\\' advanced courses. on the other hand girls chose mostly gender-neutral courses and more masculine-than feminine-perceived courses. whitehead 1996 concluded boys were avoiding courses they perceived as feminine at much higher rates than girls were avoiding courses they perceived as masculine. in addition results from a recent study by riegle-crumb et al. 2006 revealed course planning for females was contingent upon the academic achievement of female friends. having friends who earned higher grades in science math and english promoted girls\\' enrollment in advanced college preparatory coursework in those subjects. this was particularly true for girls\\' advanced math and

historical trends comparing the black and white gender gap have received surprisingly little attention. analysis of historical data from the u.s. census ipums samples shows that the gender gap in college completion has evolved differently for whites and blacks. historically the female advantage in educational attainment among blacks is linked to more favorable labor market opportunities and stronger incentives for employment for educated black women. blacks particularly black males still lag far behind whites in their rates of college completion but the striking educational gains of white women have caused the racial patterns of gender differences in college completion rates to grow more similar over time. while some have linked the disadvantaged position of black males to their

individuals to make individual and policy decisions based on the strengths and weaknesses of catholic and protestant schools. fourth if catholic and protestant schools improve further by learning from one another it might bolster the chances that the government will encourage the implementation of school choice.\\non the basis of research that has been done on the effects of religious faith and schools on various individuals there are some reasons to think that religious schools may impact academic achievement in a positive way. the fi rst of these reasons and historically probably the most acknowledged deals with a religious work ethic. this is the notion that one\\'s service to god often causes one to work more diligently. research in the social sciences has indicated consistently the existence of a religious work ethic furnham 1987 gerhards 1996 giorgi & marsh 1990 mudrack 1992 . busto 1996 and ter voert 1993 found that this religious work ethic transcends differences in race and nationality.\\na second reason to believe there might be a relationship between religious schools and academic achievement emerges from the tendency for religious schools to help students abstain from behaviors that are often regarded as undisciplined and harmful to academic achievement. a number of studies indicate that religious students and religiously oriented committed teens are less likely to become involved in drug and alcohol abuse bahr hawks & wang 1993 brownfi eld & sorenson 1991 jeynes 2005b nylander tung & xu 1996 . other studies indicate that religiously committed teens are less likely to engage in sexual behavior or become pregnant while they are still teenagers beck cole & hammond 1991 holman & harding 1996 miller & olson 1988 .\\na third reason stems from the fi nding of some studies that suggest that religious people are more likely to have an internal locus of control jackson & coursey 1988 shrauger & silverman 1971 . that is they are more likely to attribute individual success or failure to factors within one\\'s control rather than beyond one\\'s control. educational researchers have found a rather consistent relationship between possessing an internal locus of control and performing well in school garner & cole 1986 s. johnson 1992 . whatever the reasons might be for the religious school advantage over public schools there is a sense that a large percentage of the reasons rest in the school culture mok & flynn 1998 .\\nmost of the studies that have been done have focused either on comparing the achievement of students attending religious or private schools versus those going to public schools coleman 1988 coleman et al. 1982 keith & page 1985 . most of these studies have focused on the impact of students attending private schools versus public schools coleman 1988 coleman et al. 1982 . however many studies have focused all or part of their attention on religious private schools in particular bryk et al. 1993 keith & page 1985 sander 1996 . of these initiatives most have directed their attention on studying catholic schools bryk et al. 1993 keith & page 1985 sander 1996 . however in the last 25 years protestant primarily evangelical schools have constituted an increasing percentage of the total number of religious schools jeynes 2003b .\\nas a result of the signifi cant contributions of both catholic and protestant mostly evangelical schools the question arises as to whether the infl uence of these types of educational institutions are similar or different from each other sander 1996 . are the academic effects of these schools similar or different overall or across dimensions? moreover if any differences emerge are there any indications that catholic and protestant educators have something to learn from each other. if so the implications of this study may prove particularly salient. if catholics and protestants can each improve their educational outcomes by learning from each other then not only will religious education benefi t but in so doing the potency of the school choice argument will be enhanced bryk et al. 1993 gewirtz ball & bowe 1995 . the importance of determining whether there are any similarities or differences between catholic and protestant schools therefore has two important ramifi cations. first the fi ndings can be used to identify areas of strength and weakness in catholic and protestant schooling. second if these religious schools are amenable to learning from one another and religious schools improve even further the case for school choice can be fortifi ed gewirtz et al. 1995 jeynes 2002a .\\na growing number of social scientists are appreciating the importance of procuring a greater understanding of catholic and protestant education as it relates to school choice bryk et al. 1993 chubb & moe 1990 jeynes 2000 jeynes  2002a . recent research has established that even when one controls for socioeconomic status and race religious school students have an academic advantage over their counterparts in the public sector jeynes 2002a jeynes  2005a . moreover various studies consistently demonstrate that children from low-ses and minority backgrounds perform better in religious schools than they do in private schools gaziel 1997 jeynes 2002a jeynes  2003b . this is not merely a pattern that has emerged in particular individual studies but meta-analyses indicate that this is the trend of the overall body of research jeynes 2002b jeynes  2003b . given that one of the primary goals of school choice is to help poor and minority students this fi nding is especially important jeynes 2002a jeynes  2002b . other research on religiosity suggests that personal faith and family stability which are often a hallmark of christian homes also have an ameliorative infl uence on minority students brutsaert 1998 cochran 1992 cochran beeghley & bock 1992 jeynes 1999 . this research indicates that when minority children are religious and come from intact families the achievement gap that traditionally exists between white and minority students disappears jeynes 2002a .\\nthis meta-analysis is designed to compare the overall effects of catholic and protestant schools on students versus their counterparts in public schools and compared with one another. in addition those studies that used a category for non-catholic private schools were also included in the analysis as a third category because the majority of non-catholic private schools are protestant schools. this meta-analysis will address three research questions. first what are the effects of students attending catholic and protestant schools when compared with public school students? second do the effect sizes differ between catholic and protestant schools? third are there any differences in the pattern of effect sizes for catholic and protestant schools?', '45486761-a286-4b31-9acb-a86fcce985c0': 'abstract researchers teachers and policy makers continue to wrestle with

flooding from sea level rise increasing storm surge and subsidence. in these circumstances coastal management commonly based on 100-year flood maps assuming current climatology is no longer adequate. a dynamic programming cost-benefit analysis is applied to the adaptation decision illustrated by application to an energy facility in galveston bay. projections of several global climate models provide inputs to estimates of the change in hurricane and storm surge activity as well as the increase in sea level. the projected rise in physical flood risk is combined with estimates of flood damage and protection costs in an analysis of the multi-period nature of adaptation choice. the result is a planning method using dynamic programming which is appropriate for investment and abandonment decisions under rising coastal risk. \\nmany of the world's coasts have long been subject to the risk of severe storms and subsidence. one of the vulnerable areas is the u.s. east coast and the gulf of mexico and there is a long history of investment in large-scale shore protection by public agencies u.s. army corps of engineers 2003 and by private entities guarding particular facilities. traditionally this activity has been informed by 100 and 500-year flood maps based on current climatology that are prepared by the federal emergency management agency fema 2014. these maps are inputs to damage calculations-such as fema's hazus system for estimating the potential losses from disasters hazus 2014-that are used to guide the protection investments. of course protection from events with a particular return period like the 100-year flood may be augmented by judgmental safety factors that take account of the particular economic damage and human lives at risk.\\ninforming

from this study is the seven-parameters for transforming the earth-centered-earth-fixed ecef cartesian coordinates from igs14 to gom20. the frame stability of gom20 is approximately 0.3 mm/year in the horizontal directions and 0.5 mm/year in the vertical direction. the regional reference frame can be confidently used for the time window from the 1990s to 2030 without causing positional errors

the us portion of the gom region has been the heart of the us energy industry due to giant oil and gas reservoirs along the coast and offshore. in this study the gom region is bounded to the north by latitude 35 • n and to the south by latitude 13 • n as depicted in figure 1 . the gom coastal zone is defined as the contiguous area along the coast that is less than 30 meters above the global mean sea level which is depicted as dark green in figure 1 . some of the large cities within the coastal zone include houston tx new oreland la and miami tampa fl. much of the northern gom coast particularly the mississippi river delta area of louisiana is sinking [1] [2] [3] [4] . the gulf coastal region also experiences ground deformation associated with growth faults [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .\\ndespite the overall tectonic stability of the gom region localized ground deformation associated with fault creeping and land subsidence has caused frequent damages to residential and commercial structures as well as the public infrastructure. the impacts of coastal subsidence are further exacerbated by extreme weather events short term and rising sea levels long term. rising ocean water exerts sustained impacts on coastal public infrastructure and results in coastal erosion flooding and wetland loss. most of the mississippi louisiana and texas coastline has been classified by the us geological survey as \"highly vulnerable\" to coastal erosion due to coastal subsidence and sea-level rise [10] .\\ncoastal sea-level is often monitored by tide gauges. tide gauge measurements are relative to nearby benchmarks fixed on land which is historically surveyed by periodic leveling surveys and recently by global navigation satellite system gnss surveys. to be reproducible and comparable within a large area and over a long-time span the benchmark and sea-level measurements must be evaluated in a well-defined and consistent frame of reference. however the research community has difficulties in establishing a unified and consistent datum reference frame across the entire gom region to evaluate long-term land deformation and sea-level changes. different reference systems or simply reference points have been utilized in different areas during different periods by different researchers. thus it is a challenge to incorporate the published ground deformation and sea-level change results into a regional reference system. there is considerable disagreement over the rates and spatial and temporal variations of subsidence along the gom coast which eventually leads to controversies over the long-term impacts of coastal subsidence and sea-level rise. a preliminary regional geodetic reference frame named as the stable gulf of mexico reference frame was established in 2014 by a research group at the university of houston [11]. the regional reference frame was realized using seven-year-long continuous observations from 13 gnss stations adjacent to gom. the initial reference frame was aligned to the international gnss service igs reference frame 2008 igs08. igs updated its official reference frame from igs08 to igs reference frame 2014 igs14 in 2017 [12] . gnss stations within the gom region have accumulated over five years of continuous observations since 2014. this study updates the initial reference frame by removing stations that are no longer in operation and adding more reference stations in order to improve the overall geographic coverage. gnss observations as available at the beginning of 2020 are used for realizing the regional reference frame. accordingly the updated reference frame is designated as gom20. applications of gom20 in delineating rapid coastal subsidence faulting and sea-level rise are demonstrated in this article.',

those rates. our long-term goal is to understand how to improve student outcomes so the paper also uses the model to measure the effect of those institutional characteristics on graduation rates. we use data from the integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds surveys applying a weighted leastsquares procedure for grouped data to estimate an institutional-completion rates model. this analysis confirms several hypotheses about institutional determinants of graduation rates at community colleges. our results indicate a consistent negative relationship between enrollment size and completion. additionally colleges with high shares of minority students part-time students and women have lower graduation rates. a final significant finding among institutional characteristics is that greater instructional expenditures are related to a greater likelihood of graduation. the method developed here can be used to better assess the performance of community colleges.\\nis

the more proximate experiences of individuals that reproduce macro structure principle 2 this study investigates how parental academic school and peer factors mediate the association between adolescent ses and locus of control. this study contributes to the sociology of mental health social psychology and social reproduction literatures through comprehensive measurement of ses and tangible expressions of mediation from an innovative decomposition/mediation technique.\\nmore specifically these investigations employ data on 16450 us 8 th graders surveyed for the national education longitudinal study nels in 1988 and to focus on these research questions: 1 which components of ses independently predict and associate most closely with adolescents' locus of control? 2 to what extent are ses differences in adolescent locus of control mediated by parental academic school and peer factors? expanding on previous studies with a similar focus but small local samples [e.g. duval and silvia 2002 frazier et al. 2011]  this study's findings are nationally representative with rich measures on a large and diverse sample of us adolescents. although differences in control are interwoven into conceptualizations of adolescent identity kroger 2007  adolescent locus of control is understudied moilanen and shen 2014 . although neither the locus of control construct nor processes of adolescent socialization have shifted markedly since this data was collected boyd the high end of the scale take responsibility for their successes and failures ross and mirowsky 2013 . this concept has been measured in a variety of ways [see sastry 1999 gould 1999  eccles and wigfield 2002  and mirowsky ross and van willigen 1996 ]. gurin gurin and morrison 1978 distinguished between personal control and control ideology. this study focuses on the degree to which adolescents feel they have control rather than the degree to which they feel people generally have control over their own lives. as distinguished in thompson nanni and levine 1994  this study's measure blends primary control-the control one exerts over the external environment or action-with secondary control-the control one exerts internally to shape events or acceptance. finally this study focuses more on present than past or future control frazier et al. 2011  and on adolescents' sense of control over life in general rather than in one specific realm such as academics or relative to a certain type of task duval and silvia 2002 .\\nthe concept of internal control aligns closely with other indicators of mental health such as efficacy autonomy agency and instrumentalism just as external control corresponds with fatalism judge et al. 2002 . some have emphasized the distinctions between each of these terms bonetti et al. 2001  but researchers generally agree on the substantial overlap. locus of control is rooted in social learning theory or is framed as a product of environment and social interactions miller et al. 2002 . researchers find the degree to which people perceive their lives as internally rather than externally controlled varies across culture groups with for instance control more internal on average in individualistic societies than in collectivist societies gan shang and zhang 2007 . average locus of control also varies within culture groups depending on a person's social circumstances kraus piff and keltner 2009 . although many studies have focused on the more external control of socially disadvantaged persons the mechanisms producing such disparities remain unclear.\\nin correspondence with the first principle of the ssp framework identifying the most relevant macro-social conditions for the individual outcome of interest mcleod hallett and lively 2015  this study first focuses on which components of ses relate independently to adolescents' locus of control. ses is a relative measure of an individual's macro-social position and can be conceptualized in a multitude of ways with social class often juxtaposed against ses wohlfarth 1997 . bradley and corwyn 2002 described ses as building on social class' emphasis on economic position by incorporating prestige. krieger williams and moss 1997 described social class as differences in social relationships that preceded differences in occupation income wealth and education. some disciplines emphasize differences in capital bradley and corwyn 2002 . because race and ses intersect so closely in the us and are typically considered in conjunction in research on physical and mental health outcomes american psychological association 2017 williams priest and anderson 2016 this study builds on the perspective from the national institutes of health that race should be considered a component of ses oakes 2017 . the more external control of socioeconomically disadvantaged persons has been demonstrated with composite measures of ses ahlin and antunes 2015 bandura et al. 2001 falci 2011 maqsud and rouhani 1991 moilanen and shen 2014 ross mirowsky and cockerham 1983 and with measures of single ses components such as educational attainment conger et al. 2009

kiecolt 2005  moilanen and shen 2014. mirowsky ross and van willigen 1996 focused on education income and race but did not consider their simultaneous contributions. this study builds on the previous research by estimating the independent contribution of a variety of ses components:\\nparents' educational attainment family income parents' professional occupation status and the adolescent's race.\\nthis study also investigates which ses component relates most closely to adolescents' locus of control. education had an independent effect on positive personality qualities even after holding other components of ses constant menaghan and parcel 1991  and ward 2013 found the inverse effect of parents' education on perceived constraints endured into adulthood.\\nalthough family income may matter more for achievement than behavioral or psychological outcomes we generally need a clearer understanding of the mechanisms by which family income influences child development duncan and magnuson 2001 . mortimer and finch 1986 found occupational status influenced adults' social psyches more than other measures of socioeconomic status and whitbeck et al. 1997 showed the effect of the qualities of fathers' occupations on parenting and on children's outcomes persisted net of differences in income. finally researchers have argued cultural differences across racial groups may differentiate locus of control independent of racial differences in resources bradley et al. 2001  with hispanics and asians for instance expressing more fatalistic attitudes because of more collectivist cultures ross mirowsky and cockerham 1983 sastry and ross 1998 . early studies found black youth exhibited more external control than similarly resourced white youth with battle and

vocational track participants were more likely to be employed than peers experiencing economic disadvantage and those with limited or no vocational education involvement respectively. adolescents who were enrolled in a vocational track or program were more likely to be employed over 20 hours per week than other adolescents. vocational participants and economically disadvantaged youth with limited or no vocational involvement expressed low educational and occupational aspirations.\\nenrollment patterns and outcomes of adolescents in secondary vocational education have been a concern of vocational researchers and policy makers in recent years tuma 1994 . past investigations have predominantly focused on the impact of these programs on the lives of participants after the completion of high school. a number of benefits can result from involvement in secondary vocational education including lowered dropout rates enhanced attitudes toward and about work and less unemployment and better paying jobs for adults who successfully complete secondary vocational programs e.g. coyle-williams 1991 meers 1987 mortimer finch dennehy lee & beebe 1994 \\ndespite generally positive indicators of adult outcomes relatively limited information exists about participation in or the effects of secondary vocational education on the occupational experiences and aspirations of adolescents in these programs oakes 1986 stone 1988 . this lack of data may be due in part to expressed difficulties in assessing the impact of secondary vocational education on students hill harvey & praskac 1992 . the information that is available suggests that vocational programs have no real impact on improving academic achievement performance of participants. however adolescents classified as vocational concentrators report slightly higher employment rates than students enrolled in other educational programs rasinski & pedlow 1994 riesenberg & stenberg 1992. while useful additional information is needed about the involvement of adolescents in vocational programs. for example does participation in secondary vocational education have an impact on adolescents\\' work experiences? do adolescents involved in vocational programs benefit from higher occupational or educational aspirations? answers to these and similar questions would provide policy makers and educational practitioners guidance as they shape the design and delivery of occupational preparation.\\ninformation about adolescent involvement in vocational education and the influence of participation on work-related experiences could also be useful in examining the differential benefits afforded to youths with economic disadvantage. over the past 25 years varying proposals and initiatives have sought to ensure that adolescents who are economically disadvantaged are provided equal opportunities to participate in secondary vocational programs. students experiencing economic disadvantage have been targeted for special assistance in vocational education because they constitute almost one-quarter of the u.s. school population and of a growing realization that poverty can have a tremendous impact

and nondisadvantaged high school seniors. specific research objectives addressed in this study were:\\n1. describe the level of participation in vocational education courses between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged adolescents. 2. describe the effects of disadvantaged status on vocational course-taking patterns. 3. describe the effects of vocational education and disadvantaged status on high school work experiences including employment status type of employment hours worked per week and wages earned. 4. describe the effects of vocational education and disadvantaged status on postsecondary educational and occupational aspirations.\\nreview of literature\\nseveral issues that contribute to an understanding of the relationship between participation in secondary vocational education and subsequent work-related experiences will be examined in this section. first the effects of adolescents\\' work experience on academic achievement will be discussed. past research indicates that work-related experiences may actually support and extend secondary vocational instruction. mortimer et al. 1994 explained that \"given the salience of vocational issues at this time of life it is reasonable to suppose that employment would have a formative influence on the development of attitudes about work and job-related behaviors as well as general attitudes values and self-concept\" p. 40. work experience has also been shown to have a number of positive effects on adolescents including development of time and money management skills guidance in making more realistic career decisions and an understanding of employer expectations mcnelly 1990 meyer 1988 . second evidence is presented on the significant impact that socioeconomic status can have on employment outcomes. several theories will be offered as possible explanations of this phenomenon. finally a significant number of adolescents work. sum harrington and goedicke 1987 estimated that over one-half of all high school seniors work part-time during the school year. kablaoui and paulter 1991 concluded that employment appears to be an integral component of adolescent life. given the importance of work literature describing the a types of jobs held and b number of hours worked and wages received by adolescents will be discussed.\\na number of recent investigations have examined the impact of part-time work experiences on adolescents\\' lives. although the results of these studies are somewhat mixed it does appears that the effects of adolescent employment depend on the number of hours worked per week and the intensity of the work environment hanson & deridder 1994 . adolescents who work more than 20 hours per week tend to have lower grade-point averages drop out of school more frequently experience interference with social and school-related activities and express increased cynicism toward work. interestingly barton 1989 reported that adolescents who worked 20 hours or more per week were more likely than their counterparts who worked fewer hours to a be enrolled in vocational education and b expect that they would go directly to work after high school. adolescents who work less than 20 hours per week typically display no significant negative impact on their school performance d\\'amico 1984 silberman 1994 .\\nthe role of socioeconomic status on employment. why examine the impact of economic disadvantage on work experience? status attainment research has consistently demonstrated the impact of parental social status on eventual employment obtained as an adult  hotchkiss & borow 1990 . however limited information is available about the impact of family socioeconomic status ses on adolescents\\' participation in the work force. available evidence seems to suggest that lower-income adolescents are the group least likely to be employed kablaoui & paulter 1991 lewin-epstein 1981 . schill mccartin and meyer 1985 found that working students tended to have at least one parent who was employed in a high prestige occupation. smith et al. 1995 provided 1994 u.s. census bureau data which indicated that only 15.2% of youth in the lowest social class held employment as compared to 31.5% for middle class and 36.8% for upper class youth.\\ndespite the apparent effects of low ses on a lack of employment relatively limited explanations of this phenomenon have been advanced. the impact of low ses on adolescent employment can be explained in a number of ways including social cognitive theory bandura 1986 and structural sociological theory kerckhoff 1976 . social cognitive theory recognizes mutual interacting influences between people their behavior and the environment. that is personal attributes external environmental factors and overt behavior \"all operate as interlocking mechanisms that affect one another bidirectionally\" lent brown & hackett 1994 p. 82. thus the low proportion of adolescents from low ses backgrounds in the work force might be explained by the combined and interactive result of poor work attitudes a lack of positive role models and the direct result of work place discrimination.\\nstructural sociological theory is similar to social cognitive theory although it places a heavier emphasis on the role of external factors. meyer 1987 noted that:\\nstructuralist theory emphasizes the role of extra-individual or structural forces that place individuals into occupations or reward their efforts on the basis of a group characteristic such as gender or race or their placement in an external structure such as the dual labor market or an occupation with no or minimal promotion ladder. structuralist theory therefore suggests that low status and low wages result from different opportunities available to a certain type of person. p. 46\\ntypes of jobs. the majority of occupations available to adolescents are found in the secondary labor market e.g. jobs in clerical sales fast food and personal service fields meyer 1987 silberman 1994 . meyer 1988 commented that \"the work available to in-school adolescents is remarkable for its homogeneity that is reasonable since adolescents normally work at low-skill entry-level secondary labor-market jobs\" p. 54. in addition the types of jobs held by male and female adolescents tends to follow traditional patterns. female students hold primarily sales clerical and health-related positions whereas males have a tendency to dominate food service labor repair and custodial jobs kablaoui & paulter 1991 . given the focus of vocational education programs designed for high-tech high skills occupations and on preparing youth for occupations considered nontraditional for their gender it is possible that involvement in vocational education may have a positive influence on the type of employment obtained while still in high school. to date this information is not available in the general research literature.\\nstates is substantial kablaoui & paulter 1991 mortimer et al. 1994 .\\nu.s. department of education surveys [show] that half of all sophomores two-thirds of all juniors and nearly three-fourths of all seniors hold jobs during the school year. the average high school senior works more than 20 hours weekly in addition to a 30-hour school week. silberman 1994 p. 66 meyer 1988 found that the same factors that affect wages in adults also affect those of adolescents namely sex age or experience and family ses. meyer indicated that while results for adults do not necessarily need to be applicable to adolescents \"in the area of wage differences adolescent wages mirror the adult wage gap\" p. 46. gender plays a significant role in determining wages. in fact research shows a consistent wage gap between adolescent males and females where female workers tend to be paid less than their male counterparts for performing the same job duties. the disparity in wages between males and females remains through adulthood d\\'amico 1984 meyer 1987 . a notable exception to this general trend was reported by mortimer et al. 1994 who noted that initial wage differences by sex steadily decreased during adolescence.\\npostsecondary aspirations are important because of the potential that lowered aspirations have on precluding involvement in certain types of activities. through a complex set of processes and interactions high aspirations may enhance opportunities to attain high prestige occupations while lowered aspirations may limit occupational possibilities. for example adolescents who do not complete certain academic prerequisite courses in middle school are often unable to enroll in advanced mathematics and science courses in high school. a lack of academic prerequisites then all but eliminates the possibility of attaining a college degree which results in diminished opportunities for attaining high prestige occupations lent brown & hackett 1994 rosenbaum 1981 .\\na major argument of proponents for secondary vocational education and adolescent work experience is that they instill high educational and occupational aspirations kablaoui & paulter 1991 . if this assertion is true involvement could be especially important for youth who are economically disadvantaged as they are more likely to report lower prestige occupational aspirations than advantaged peers. thus the potential impact of economic disadvantage and degree of involvement in vocational education must be taken into account when examining educational and occupational aspirations. systemic institutional bias and structural barriers erected on the basis of social class can lead to limited occupational aspirations and availability beyond individual control. in fact occupational aspirations may actually reflect the effects of discrimination social attitudes cultural expectations and stereotypes gottfredson 1986 hotchkiss & borow 1990 mitchell & krumboltz 1990 . negative cultural perceptions and expectations based on social class may impose lower status and a devalued role on adolescents. the effects of bias can result in limited career aspirations for disadvantaged youths that reflect narrow stereotypical employment possibilities rojewski 1994 rojewski & yang in press.\\nnels:88-94 database. the national education longitudinal study: 1988-94 nels:88 1996 database administered by the national center for educational statistics u.s. department of education was used for this study. nels:88 is the third in an ongoing series of major nationally-representative longitudinal studies sponsored by the federal government to study the educational vocational and personal development of adolescents and young adults. the nels:88 data set was originally designed as a general purpose data set for developing and examining federal policy on education. specifically nels:88 focuses on a number of interrelated policy issues including the identification of attributes associated with educational and occupational aspiration and achievement and the transition of different types of students from eighth grade to secondary school to postsecondary environments ingels et al. 1994 .\\nselection of participants initially was based on a two-stage stratified sample with schools as the first-stage unit and a random sample of students within each selected school as the second-stage unit. initial school selection was also based on unequal probabilities in order to obtain adequate numbers of selected underrepresented student subgroups. thus normalized sampling weights were needed to obtain unbiased population estimates. nels:88 researchers employed a two-stage weighting process that a calculated unadjusted weights as the inverse of the probabilities of selection accounting for the sample selection process and b adjusted initial weights to compensate for nonresponse. the relative weight of all applicable crosssectional weights supplied by nels:88 researchers was calculated and applied owings et al. 1994 . additional details about this data set can be found in recent nels:88 user\\'s manuals and technical reports e.g. haggerty dugoni reed cederlund & taylor 1996 ingels et al. 1994 owings et al. 1994 sanderson dugoni rasinski & taylor 1996 .\\nthe nels:88 data set was selected for this analysis because of several positive features. one strength of the database is the inclusion of numerous items that specifically examine the aspirations both educational and occupational and work experiences of adolescents. a second reason for selection is that the database represents a nationally-representative sample of thousands of high school seniors selected through a rigorous two-stage stratified probability design. third ease of access and use was considered. the entire nels:88-94 database containing data from each stage of data collection is available on cd-rom and easily accessed and analyzed using standard statistical analytic packages such as sas or spss.\\nsample data set. the sample for this investigation consisted of adolescents who were high school seniors in 1992 who provided valid responses to select questions related to work participation in vocational education courses and postsecondary aspirations. some participants were eliminated from the final data pool for a number of reasons including questionnaire nonresponse missing data on key questions e.g. level of participation in vocational education and dropping out of school prior to grade 12. this winnowing process resulted in a total weighted data pool of 12009 student-based cases which included 2289 adolescents who were economically disadvantaged male n = 1105 female n = 1184 and 9720 considered nondisadvantaged male n = 4989 female n = 4731. a majority of adolescents who were economically disadvantaged were white n = 1188 but higher percentages of african american 36.9% and hispanic youth 44.1% were represented in the disadvantaged group as compared to white adolescents 13.3%.\\ndemographic variables. information about gender race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status i.e. economic disadvantage were collected from student questionnaires. socioeconomic status ses was conceptualized and calculated by nels:88 researchers and reflects a composite score composed of five separate variables including family income parents\\' education levels and parents\\' occupations owings et al. 1994 . responses to each of these five items were standardized by nels:88 researchers to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. nonmissing standardized components were then averaged to yield a ses composite score for each participant. composite ses scores were also categorized into quartiles. for this analysis economic disadvantage was defined as all ses composite scores falling in the lowest quartile.\\nwhen the disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged groups are examined several distinct descriptive features emerge. first 55.8% of all families in the disadvantaged group reported a family income of less than $15000 per year. this figure $15000 roughly equates to the established federal income guidelines in determining financial poverty for a family of four. an additional quarter of the families in this group reported incomes less than $25000 per year. the number of dependents per household can account for some of the families that reported higher incomes but were still included in the lowest economic quartile. in contrast 66.0% of the families in the nondisadvantaged category reported incomes of $35000 per year or higher a full 25.0% reported incomes in the $50000-74000 range. in terms of educational attainment 83.7% of disadvantaged parents and 67.8% of spouses who completed the questionnaire indicated attaining a high school diploma ged or less. this figure compares with only 25.6% of nondisadvantaged parents 25.3% of spouses who reported receiving this same level of education. fully three-fourths of parents in the nondisadvantaged category received some type of postsecondary education or training. this general description is somewhat constrained by the data made available by the nels:88 researchers e.g. coding scheme using categorical rather than continuous data use of composite scores for describing ses. even so the categorization process appears to have produced two distinct groups that generally reflect both the federal guidelines on determining economic disadvantage and the overall percentage of youth living in poverty in the u.s. smith et al. 1995 .\\nstudents were assigned to categories that represented varying levels of participation in vocational educationa no vocational course work b one or more vocational courses but not in vocational track and c one or more vocational courses and enrolled in the vocational track. work experience was conceptualized as a trichotomous variable including a no past paid work experience b past work experience but currently unemployed and c currently employed.\\nmeasurement of educational and occupational aspirations. educational aspirations were determined by asking respondents to denote the highest level of education they thought they would achieve. for analysis educational aspirations were conceptualized as categorical and as an interval-level construct haller & virkler 1993 with a low score of 1 representing aspirations less than high school and a high score of 6 representing aspirations for a graduate degree e.g. masters degree doctoral degree or equivalent.\\noccupational aspirations were assessed by asking students to indicate the job they expected to have at 30 years of age from a listing of 17 separate occupational categories. for data analysis occupational aspirations were coded using the socioeconomic index sei codes stevens & cho 1985 . this socioeconomic index provides a 4-digit sei code that represents the income and educational attributes found in the total labor force and represent prestige scores. sei prestige codes were chosen for several reasons:\\n1. to provide a continuous variable for aspirations that facilitated data analysis 2. because prestige levels influence peoples\\' perceptions about the relative worth power and status of occupations kraus schild & hodge 1978 stevens & cho 1985  and 3. because sei codes reflect status expectations and ability estimates that can be used in considering individual and societal constraints on career choice hotchkiss & borow 1990 salteil 1988 .\\nseveral coding decisions were necessary in order to reconcile the different schemes employed by the nels:88 database and sei. first three high prestige occupational categories high professional low professional school teacher were assigned the same sei code 68.51 since these types of occupations were all found within the broader sei category labeled professional specialty. second since no separate code was available for small business owner this occupation was assigned the same sei code 53.34 as that designated for manager. third the occupational category of military was designated the sei code attributed to protective services 30.13. finally adolescents with aspirations not represented by the 17 preestablished categories were assigned the overall mean score sei m = 34.48 reported by stevens and cho 1985 .\\nthis research study contained four primary objectives designed to examine how disadvantaged status influences participation in vocational education programs and vocational course-taking patterns and the combined influences of disadvantaged status and involvement in vocational education on adolescent work experiences and postsecondary aspirations. the results of data analysis for each objective are presented in subsequent paragraphs.\\nthe first research objective sought to describe the influence of disadvantaged status on adolescent participation in vocational education courses. level of participation in vocational education was arranged into three distinct categoriesa never enrolled in a vocational education course n = 6613 b participation in vocational courses but not in vocational track n = 4147 and c participation in vocational courses and in vocational track n = 1249. the percentage of disadvantaged youth enrolled in the vocational track was slightly more than double the percentage found for nondisadvantaged counterparts in this category. conversely the percentage of youth who reported no prior participation in vocational education was greater for nondisadvantaged adolescents. the proportion of students who reported past involvement in one or more vocational courses but were not enrolled in a vocational track was relatively equal for both disadvantaged status groups see table 1 .\\ninsert table 1 about here\\nthe second objective of this study was to describe the potential effects of disadvantaged status on vocational education course-taking patterns. overall a greater percentage of disadvantaged youth n = 546 23.8% reported being enrolled in the vocational education track than nondisadvantaged counterparts n = 968 10.0%. likewise a greater percentage of disadvantaged adolescents n = 1095 47.8% participated in a general education curriculum than nondisadvantaged peers n = 3758 38.7%. nondisadvantaged youth n = 4994 51.4% were almost twice as likely to be enrolled in an academic or college prep curriculum than disadvantaged youth n = 649 28.3%.\\nwhen looking at vocational program enrollment only a greater percentage of disadvantaged youth participated in most vocational programs including technology education business education health occupations and trades occupations programs. in fact enrollment in marketing education was the only vocational program area where a relative balance existed between disadvantaged and nondisadvantaged participants see figure 1 .\\ninsert figure 1 about here\\nthe third research objective was designed to describe the possible influence of disadvantaged status and participation in vocational education on high school work experiences. four aspects related to adolescents\\' work experience were chosen including employment status type of employment hours worked per week and wages. results for each of these areas are described in the following paragraphs.\\nemployment status. employment status was conceptualized as three mutually exclusive categories including no prior work experience prior work experience but currently unemployed and currently employed. over half of all adolescents in this sample were employed with the exception of disadvantaged students without prior vocational course work. adolescents enrolled in a vocational program regardless of disadvantaged status reported higher employment rates than their disadvantaged or nondisadvantaged peers respectively with less or no involvement in vocational education. nondisadvantaged youth reported higher employment rates than their disadvantaged peers. this trend was especially true for those enrolled in vocational programs where approximately two-thirds of nondisadvantaged adolescents were employed compared to slightly over one-half of disadvantaged youth. conversely disadvantaged students were almost twice as likely as their nondisadvantaged counterparts to report no prior work experience. almost one-quarter of all economically disadvantaged youth without any vocational course work also reported no past work history. these youth may be at particularly high risk of work-related problems in the transition from school to work see table 2 .\\ninsert table 2 about here type of employment. specific types of employment were categorized to approximate the types of occupations found in various vocational education programs. roughly one-third of all adolescents reported working at a fast food restaurant. disadvantaged youth were more likely to work in this type of occupation than nondisadvantaged peers. in contrast nondisadvantaged adolescents were more likely to be employed in sales-related occupations. an exception was found for youth who had participated in prior vocational courses. here the rate of employment was fairly equal for all youth regardless of disadvantaged status. while a small percentage of respondents reported being employed in farm work/general labor disadvantaged youth were twice as likely to report this status as compared to nondisadvantaged peers. adolescents regardless of disadvantaged status who were enrolled in a vocational program were more likely to be employed in mechanical or general repair occupations than youths who had less or no prior involvement in vocational course work. a similar but somewhat less pronounced effect is also present for general office occupations see table 3 .\\ninsert table 3 about here\\nhours. several interesting patterns were observed in response to the following questionnaire item: how many hours do/did you usually work each week on your current or most recent job during this school year? first the percentage of youth who worked between 11 and 20 hours per week was fairly comparable among all six sub-groups defined by vocational involvement and disadvantaged status. second vocational participants regardless of disadvantaged status were more likely than their nonvocational counterparts to work more than 20 hours per week. however disadvantaged youth with limited or no prior involvement in vocational education were also more likely than their nondisadvantaged peers to work 21 or more hours weekly. in fact adolescents with limited or no prior vocational education were most likely to work the least number of hours less than 10 hours per week see table 4 .\\ninsert table 4 about here wages. three-fourths of all adolescents regardless of status or program involvement earned at or slightly above the minimum wage the minimum wage was $4.25 in 1992 when data were collected from high school seniors. disadvantaged youth at all three participation levels were less likely than nondisadvantaged peers to earn above $6.00 per hour and more likely to earn less than the minimum wage. interestingly increased involvement in vocational education also increased the percentage of disadvantaged youth who received less than the minimum wage see table 5 .\\ninsert table 5 about here\\nthe final research objective sought to describe the potential influence of participation in vocational education and disadvantaged status on adolescents\\' educational and occupational aspirations. group mean scores for educational aspirations were calculated by asking participants to indicate the highest level of education they thought they would achieve. educational aspiration scores ranged from 1-6 with 1 indicating aspirations less than a high school diploma and 6 indicating aspirations for graduate education. occupational aspirations were coded using sei prestige codes stevens & cho 1985 which have a possible range from a low of 13.98 to a high of 90.45 m = 34.48. separate statistical analyses two-way analysis of variance were performed to examine differences in educational and occupational aspirations based on disadvantaged status 2 groups and participation in vocational education 3 groups.\\nthe magnitude or strength of observed differences was also examined because differences that are \"highly significant [sic] statistically i.e. are very unlikely to have occurred by chance may nevertheless have a very small effect size i.e. have virtually no practical effect on the outcomes of interest\" haller & virkler 1993 p. 173. problems with interpreting statistical differences are often most apparent when large databases are analyzed and statistically significant results are more of a reflection of large sample size than practically significant differences. magnitude was determined by eta 2 which is an estimate of the variance accounted for by the analysis of variance anova procedure. measures of effect size e.g. eta 2  can provide information about the relative importance or strength of an observed difference although interpretation is contextual somewhat subjective and dependent on research goals kellow 1994 .\\neducational aspirations. adolescents in the vocational track reported the lowest educational aspirations regardless of disadvantaged status disadvantaged m = 3.74 nondisadvantaged m = 3.96. educational aspirations appeared to increase as involvement in vocational education decreased for both non-track participation disadvantaged m = 4.24 nondisadvantaged m = 4.83 and nonparticipation disadvantaged m = 4.59 nondisadvantaged m = 5.13. a two-way analysis of variance anova using disadvantaged status and level of vocational participation as grouping variables resulted in a statistically significant interaction f 2 11194 = 10.37 p < .001. youth in the vocational track group held somewhat similar educational aspirations regardless of disadvantaged status. however disadvantaged youth with limited or no vocational course work held lower educational aspirations than their nondisadvantaged counterparts especially for those youth without any prior involvement in vocational education. the effect size i.e. eta 2  for this statistically significant interaction was calculated at .114 meaning that the two grouping variables accounted for 11.4% of the variance found in educational aspirations.\\ndescriptive data revealed that adolescents in the vocational track group were more likely to aspire to a high school education than other students. disadvantaged youth at all levels of program involvement were twice as likely to aspire to some type of 2-year postsecondary education than nondisadvantaged peers. disadvantaged youth were less likely to aspire to a college degree than nondisadvantaged counterparts see table 6 .\\ninsert table 6 ', '5417073b-8b3b-4e2f-8cd1-b2f1ea892290': \"abstract longitudinal studies offer opportunities for studying children

concern of those interested in the health of our system of government and the well-being of the citizenry. for much of the nation\\'s history our leaders have viewed civics education as a means of realizing the country\\'s democratic ideals. in the past decade low levels of youth voting and non-pro½-cient student performance on a widely respected civics assessment test have elicited efforts to increase the amount and quality of time spent teaching civic education and have ignited a movement to create common standards in the social studies. complicating these efforts is ideological disagreement about the content that should be taught and the values that ought to be inculcated. validating the belief in the worth of civics education and underscoring the importance of reform efforts data reveal that schooling in civics and other related cocurricular activities are associated with increased knowledge of the u.s. system of government and heightened participation in democratic activities such as voting.\\nreformers seeking to increase the quality and accessibility of civic education in schools confront ½ve challenges. first neither the federal government nor the states have made high-quality civics education a priority a conclusion justi½ed by evidence showing that the systematic study of civics in high school is not universal that fewer high school civics courses are offered now than were offered in the past that the time devoted to teaching the subject in lower grades has been reduced and that most states do not require meaningful civics assessment. second social studies textbooks may not adequately convey the knowledge or facilitate development of the skills required of an informed engaged citizenry. third consequential differences in access and outcomes between upper-and lower-class students persist. fourth cutbacks in funding for schools make implementation of changes in any area of the curriculum dif½cult. fifth the polarized political climate increases the likelihood that curricular changes will be cast as advancing a partisan agenda.\\nthroughout much of its history the united states has \"relied upon government schools as a principal purveyor of deeply cherished democratic values.\" 2 so interconnected are education and citizenship that some historians contend that \"the most basic purpose of america\\'s schools is to teach children the moral and intellectual responsibilities of living and working in a democracy.\" 3 consistent with this view americans \"have expected schools to prepare future citizens nurturing in children loyalty and common values and forging from them a strong national character.\" 4 among the implications of these arguments is the notion that the classroom is both the training ground for democracy and the incubator of its leaders.\\nscholars of u.s. history argue that \"it was ½rst religion and next education that engaged the attention of the early settlers.\" 5 whereas the puritans justi½ed the teaching of reading primarily as a means of accessing scripture benjamin franklin envisioned schooling as a means of \"laying such a foundation of knowledge and ability as properly improved may qualify [individuals] to pass through and execute the several of½ces of civil life with advantage and reputation to themselves and country.\" 6 unsurprisingly then those governing under the articles of confederation signaled education\\'s centrality to national well-being as early as the land ordinance of 1785 which \"set aside the sixteenth section of government land in each township for school support.\" two years later article three of the northwest ordinance of 1787 proclaimed \"religion morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" 7 recognizing the importance of education in developing the capacities of citizenship early u.s. presidents championed government-supported schooling for at least some citizens. as a result the military academy at west point was established in 1802. in the years that followed the founders continued to associate an educated populace with a secure union. motivating george washington\\'s argument for a national university for example was his belief that the assimilation of the principles opinions and manners of our country-men by the common education of a portion of our youth from every quarter well deserves attention. the more homogenous our citizens can be made in these particulars the greater will be our prospect of permanent union and a primary object of such a national institution should be the education of our youth in the science of government.\\n\"in a republic\" the father of the nation asked \"what species of knowledge can be equally important and what duty more pressing on its legislature than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the country?\" 8 in a like vein thomas jefferson included public education along with roads rivers and canals in a list of \"objects of public improvement as it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers.\" 9 drawing a similar connection between education and the productive exercise of citizenship president james madison argued in his second annual message:\\ni . . . invite your attention to the advantages of superadding [sic] to the means of education provided by the several states a seminary of learning instituted by the national legislature within the limits of their exclusive jurisdiction. . . . such an institution though local in its legal character would be universal in its bene½cial effects. by enlightening the opinions by expanding the patriotism and by assimilating the principles the sentiments and the manners of those who might resort to this temple of science to be redistributed in due time through every part of the community sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished the features of national character would be multiplied and greater extent given to social harmony. but above all a well-constituted seminary in the center of the nation is recommended by the consideration that the additional instruction emanating from it would contribute not less to strengthen the foundations than to adorn the structure of our free and happy system of government. 10 these presidential encomia to the indispensable role of education in a democracy pre½gure the enactment of such landmark legislation as the 1862 morrill act which gave each state federal land to establish land grant colleges and the 1965 elementary and secondary education act esea which gave public schools federal assistance and oversight.\\nthe importance of schooling was magni½ed by the young country\\'s impulse to turn away from primogeniture and entail. \"the english laws concerning the transmission of property were abolished in almost all the states at the time of the revolution\" noted alexis de tocqueville. \"the law of entail was so modi½ed as not materially to interrupt the free circulation of property. . . . [t] he families of the great landed proprietors are almost all commingled with the general mass. . . . the last trace of hereditary ranks and distinctions is destroyed.\" 11 unsurprisingly the educational system that ultimately developed in the united states bore the imprint of the country\\'s founding philosophy. if taken seriously principles such as freedom of speech and of assembly and consent of the governed should be construed as inviting education of the many. the need for public schools was also driven by the extension of voting rights ½rst beyond the propertied class and eventually to african americans and women. \"education must be universal\" argued horace mann. \"it is well when the wise and the learned discover new truths but how much better to diffuse the truth already discovered amongst the multitude. . . . with us the quali½cation of voters is as important as the quali½cation of governors and even comes ½rst in the natural order.\" 12 and as the country faced the challenge of absorbing waves of immigrants during the turbulent gilded age and progressive era educators came to see public schools \"as helping different groups assimilate into american culture and society.\" 13 \"for many generations of immigrants\" write historian of education diane ravitch and public policy expert joseph viteritti \"the common school was the primary teacher of patriotism and civic values.\" 14 unlike its european counterpart the u.s. educational system \"reflected the ideal of equality\" an aspiration expressed in the notion of \"educational opportunity for all regardless of wealth and ability.\" 15 still the country was more than a halfcentury old before \"real efforts to achieve universal opportunities for education\" were undertaken. and \"[e]ven after the 1840s . . . most boys could not expect to attend school for more than a few years and girls could hardly hope to attend at all.\" 16 the extent to which the country failed to realize its ideals was evident in the fact that when the fourteenth amendment was adopted in 1868 common taxsupported schooling had not yet taken hold in the south and the education of those identi½ed as \"negroes\" was still forbidden by law in some states. 17 those who feared an empowered rabble challenged the notion that universal education would bene½t both the individual and the country. on the other side of the argument jeffersonians echoed the sentiments of the author of the declaration of independence who noted that \"[i]f a nation expects to be ignorant and free in a state of civilization it expects what never was and never will be.\" 18 whereas jefferson envisioned an \"aristocracy of worth and genius\" 19 the worriers forecast that the combination of widespread schooling and its corollary expanded suffrage would vest elected power in those leastrather than best-suited to govern.\\nin the contest over these competing worldviews jefferson\\'s prevailed. \"in new england\" tocqueville noted in 1838 \"every citizen receives the elementary notions of human knowledge he is taught moreover the doctrines and the evidences of his religion the history of his country and the leading features of its constitution.\" 20 the state of affairs we assume today had its roots in arguments made by such champions of education as pennsylvania\\'s thaddeus stevens who told that state\\'s house of representatives:\\nif then education be of admitted importance to the people under all forms of governments and of unquestioned necessity when they govern themselves it follows of course that its cultivation and diffusion is a matter of public concern and a duty which every government owes to its people. 21 because views such as jefferson\\'s and stevens\\'s won the day \"[o]ver 49 million students\" headed \"to approximately 99000 public elementary and secondary schools for the fall 2011 term\" at an estimated one-year cost of $525 billion. 22 on the role of schooling in inculcating the values of citizenship contemporary presidents share the founders\\' views. thus for example president ronald reagan noted \"since the founding of this nation education and democracy have gone hand in hand.\" 23 similarly president george w. bush observed \"a love of democratic principles must be taught.\" 24 and president bill clinton challenged \"all our schools to teach character education to teach good values and good citizenship.\" 25 in the past decade a number of major initiatives have concentrated on enhancing educational quality at the elementary and secondary levels. signed into law in january 2002 the no child left behind act nclb focused on increased student pro½ciency in language arts and mathematics. in 2007 nclb added student pro½ciency in science to its goals. in light of the long-lived perception that education should increase civic knowledge and enhance the capacities of citizenship it is surprising that title i of nclb did not list civic education as a priority.\\nthat omission is seen by some as a sign that other priorities have displaced civic education on the public agenda. reformers have been motivated by concerns that civic education is not as central to public schooling as it once was. they worry that the standards movement may have inadvertently made the delivery of high-quality civic education more dif½cult. the largest group responding to both of these concerns is the civic mission of the schools cms coalition. 26 in response to low levels of voting and civics knowledge among the young in coalition now includes more than sixty participating organizations and individuals representing groups concerned with civic learning general education civic engagement policy-making civil rights and business.\\nthe 2003 civic mission of schools report argued that schools should not only \"help young people acquire and learn to use the skills knowledge and attitudes that will prepare them to be competent and responsible citizens throughout their lives\" but also work to ensure that students:\\n• are informed and thoughtful. they have a grasp and an appreciation of history and the fundamental processes of american democracy an understanding and awareness of public and community issues an ability to obtain information when needed a capacity to think critically and a willingness to enter into dialogue with others about different points of view and to understand diverse perspectives. they are tolerant of ambiguity and resist simplistic answers to complex questions.\\n• participate in their communities. they belong to and contribute to groups in civil society that offer venues for americans to participate in public service work together to overcome problems and pursue an array of cultural social political and religious interests and beliefs.\\n• act politically. they have the skills knowledge and commitment needed to accomplish public purposes-for instance by organizing people to address social issues solving problems in groups speaking in public petitioning and protesting to influence public policy and voting.\\n• have moral and civic virtues. they are concerned for the rights and welfare of others and are socially responsible willing to listen to alternative perspectives and con½dent in their capacity to make a difference. 29 since its inception in 2003 cms has:\\n• developed state-level campaign coalitions in each state.\\n• developed an online database of more than two hundred civic-learning practice examples. the civic learning online database contains best-practice examples of each of the six promising civic-learning practices of the civic mission of schools report.\\n• helped the cms state af½liates pass nearly seventy pieces of supportive state legislation in thirty-½ve states during the 2004 to 2010 legislative sessions.\\n• conducted a study of schools and school districts around the nation that are meeting their civic mission through employment of the six promising practices of the civic mission of schools report.\\n• participated in efforts to create common standards for social studies education.\\nelements of this reform agenda are con- the ½rst issue is whether civic education that is publicly mandated must be minimal so that parental choice can be maximal. the second issue concerns the way in which publicly subsidized schools should respond to the increasingly multicultural character of societies. the third issue is whether democratic education should try to cultivate cosmopolitan or patriotic sentiments among students. 31 the heat generated by the controversy over content is evident in the thomas b. fordham institute\\'s 2003 publication where did social studies go wrong? 32 in the foreword to that work fordham foundation president chester e. finn jr. laid the failures of social studies at the feet of the social studies establishment:\\nevidence also accumulated that in the ½eld of social studies itself the lunatics had taken over the asylum. its leaders were people who had plenty of grand degrees and impressive titles but who possessed no respect for western civilization who were inclined to view america\\'s evolution as a problem for humanity rather than mankind\\'s last best hope who pooh-poohed history\\'s chronological and factual skeleton as somehow \"privileging\" elites and white males over the poor and oppressed who saw the study of geography in terms of despoiling the rain forest rather than locating london or the mississippi river on a map who interpreted \"civics\" as consisting largely of political activism and \"service learning\" rather than understanding how laws are made and why it is important to live in a society governed by laws. 33 evidence from a 2010 survey of social studies teachers calls finn\\'s assessment into question. in a national random sample of 866 public high school teachers and an oversample of 245 catholic and private high school instructors 83 percent viewed the united states \"as a unique country that stands for something special in the world\" 82 percent thought pupils should be taught to \"respect and appreciate their country but know its shortcomings\" and only 1 percent wanted students to learn \"that the u.s. is a fundamentally flawed country.\" 34 the ideological tensions at play here were also on display in the early 1990s when those attempting to develop national guidelines for the teaching of american history faced off against critics including national endowment for the humanities chair lynne cheney over the balance between focusing on past injustices and on narratives centered on traditional historical ½gures.\\nin the broad sweep of things efforts to expand the focus of textbooks have succeeded. as a result of challenges to traditional accounts that excluded the struggles of blacks and women for example the content of social studies texts has changed remarkably over the past half-century. in the 1940s for example dred scott was the only black individual featured more than once by the 1960s and even more so by the 1980s texts contained a notable amount of multicultural and feminist content. 35 increasingly textbook publishers have incorporated the aspiration that \"students can learn about multiple viewpoints and competing narratives.\" 36 still clashes among competing views of social studies are so intense that education scholar ronald evans has labeled them the \"social studies wars.\" 37 even though social studies was ignored in nclb states have standardized their civics curricula \"as part of the sweeping trend toward greater teacher accountability and systemized decision making.\" 38 since 1989 when a national education summit convened by president george h.w. bush made the case for common standards every state has developed standards of learning in curricular areas including social studies which is de½ned as the core academic area consisting of civics history economics and geography. influencing these deliberations were the two voluntary sets of social studies standards developed by the national council for the social studies 39 and the center for civic education. 40 however as the states have revised their standards over the years benchmarks have proliferated to the point that even the most skilled teacher would have dif½-culty meeting them within the available class time. in short rather than improving the state of civic education the standards movement may in some ways have undercut it. as the guardian of democracy report notes \"in social studies standards revisions . . . most states have added to the amount of material to be covered rather than developing fewer and clearer standards that encourage an understanding of the vital importance of citizen engagement in our democracy.\" 41 recognizing the problem in june 2010 the national governors association center for best practices and the council of chief state school of½cers released a set of state-led education standards designed to reduce the number and increase the quality of the standards set in math and science. since then forty-seven states have agreed to implement the common core state standards in those two subjects. although acceptance by the states was voluntary president barack obama\\'s department of education accelerated adoption by making it a criterion for entry into the federal race to the top education grant competition.\\npush back against the standards took two very different forms. some argued that the math standards were problematic because they were lower than those in place in high-achieving states such as massachusetts. 42 others contended that national standards would stifle innovation in the states and constituted an unconstitutional expansion of federal authority. 43 motivated in part by the albert shanker institute\\'s influential 2003 study educating democracy: state standards to ensure a civic core 44 reformers are now focused on clarifying the standards in social studies. the shanker study found that standards in many states consisted simply of a laundry list of people events and dates to be memorized and therefore failed to develop civic competence and critical thinking.\\nin early 2010 the cms coalition and the national council for the social studies agreed to develop common state standards in the social studies designed to prepare students for informed and engaged citizenship and so they established a task force to pursue that goal. working with the states the task force is charged with: 1 drafting and agreeing on the actual standards\\n2 identifying assessment instruments for use with the standards and 3 developing resources to help teachers use the standards and assessments effectively.\\nto date twenty-one states have joined the effort to develop common state standards.\\ndecades of scholarship suggest that civics classes and certain cocurricular activities help develop the civic skills transmit the knowledge and inculcate the civic dispositions valorized by the civic mission of schools. speci½cally schooling in civics increases knowledge of our system of government and its history and laws builds students\\' con½dence in their ability to exercise the prerogatives of citizenship and increases participation in the community and in governments including voting. in the presence of controls for other factors that could affect civics knowledge having taken classes in that subject predicts a command of central concepts 45 an increase reflected in improved performance on the national assessment of educational progress naep test. 46 civics education also heightens students\\' con½dence in their ability to perform such participatory functions as writing a letter to congress. 47 by increasing the representativeness and perceived legitimacy of our system of government as well as the accountability of its leaders widespread citizen voting protects democratic governance as surely as lackluster civic participation jeopardizes it. with balloting in u.s. presidential contests hovering around 50 percent of those eligible u.s. voter participation falls far from the democratic ideal. overall the percentage that chooses to cast a ballot in u.s. elections compares unfavorably to that of many other developed countries. in general for example turnout in u.s. elections is lower than in comparable ones in much of europe and canada. although balloting among eighteen to twenty-nine year olds increased in 2008 it remained proportionately below that of other age groups.\\nthese data signal the importance of the link between civics education and an inclination to act on the notion that voting is a citizen\\'s right and duty. in particular completing a year\\'s worth of coursework in civics or american government heightens one\\'s propensity to vote by 3 to 6 percent. 48 involvement in some forms of extracurricular activities and voluntary associations predicts increased balloting as well. 49 programs that engage students in gathering and using information in political contexts both increase basic knowledge about our governmental system and stimulate voting behavior. 50 so too do course exercises that involve newspaper reading. 51 importantly evidence drawn from the national education longitudinal study correlates participation in student government with increased civic and political participation. 52 these ½ndings are consistent with those drawn from the national education longitudinal study and the national longitudinal study of adolescent health that revealed that high school students active in \"youth voluntary associations\" are more politically engaged in adulthood. 53 speci½c curricula have also yielded robust effects. a randomized ½eld experiment concluded that involvement \"in student voices signi½cantly boosted students\\' con½dence in their ability to make informed political decisions their knowledge about how to register to vote and their belief that their vote matters.\" 54 moreover in a randomized controlled experiment \"participation in facing history and ourselves programs result [ed] in: greater engagement in learning increased skills for understanding and analyzing history greater empathy and ethical awareness increased civic knowledge skills and dispositions an improved ability to recognize racism anti-semitism and other forms of bigotry in themselves and in others and reduced racist attitudes and self-reported ½ghting.\" 55 some civics programs such as kids voting usa have been shown to create a trickle-up effect not only increasing the knowledge level and civic dispositions of the young but enhancing their parents\\' political knowledge as well. 56 evidence also suggests that inclusion of civics education in a curriculum may correlate with a decreased dropout rate. 57 in a similar vein student involvement in service learning has produced civic bene½ts. as the corporation for national and community service notes \"[t]he state of youth volunteering is robustwith 55% of youth participating in volunteer activities each year-and . . . the level of their volunteer commitment is directly related to the nature of the social institutions with which they interact.\" 58 the guardian of democracy report adds \"service learning is far more than community service alone high-quality service learning experiences incorporate intentional opportunities for students to analyze and solve community problems through the application of knowledge and skills.\" 59 when well executed service learning can have positive effects on civic knowledge and engagement. 60 despite the fact that civic education produces an array of positive outcomes the citizenry\\'s current level of civic knowledge is far from ideal and the role of civic education in schools is far from secure.\\nover the last half of the twentieth century political scientists michael delli carpini and scott keeter observe levels of political knowledge changed little a conclusion made more remarkable by the fact that education levels in the citizenry increased markedly over that period. 61 in practice this ½nding means that in the mid-1990s high school graduates\\' knowledge was about the same as that of high school dropouts in the late 1940s college graduates of the mid-1990s were more or less comparable to high school graduates at the end of world war ii. 62 leaders of both political parties have joined prominent scholars in lamenting the fact that according to the rigorous standards set by the naep a majority of our elementary and secondary students are not pro½cient in civics. as president obama has noted \"the loss of quality civic education from so many of our classrooms has left too many young americans without the most basic knowledge of who our forefathers are or the signi½cance of the founding documents.\" they were unaware of \"the risks and sacri½ces made by previous generations to ensure that this country survived war and depression through the great struggles for civil and social and worker\\'s rights. it is up to us then to teach them.\" 63 consistent with this view the 2006 naep concluded that 27 percent of twelfth graders were at a pro½cient level and 66 percent at or above the basic level.\\nalthough the 2010 naep 64 found that the average score for fourth graders was higher than it had been in either 1998 or 2006 there was no year-over-year improvement in grades eight or twelve. and overall the performance levels of all three grades were unimpressive. \"twenty-seven percent of fourth-graders 22 percent of eighth-graders and 24 percent of twelfth-graders performed at or above the pro½cient level in civics in 2010.\" 65 not all of the news about students\\' performance in civics is negative. by international standards u.s. students hold their own. in contrast to their subpar command of math and science relative to other countries on civic knowledge and skills u.s. students fair reasonably well. when compared to students in other industrialized nations in an international study of twenty-eight democracies american fourteen year olds performed at a higher level than their counterparts in other democracies. 66 u.s. students also outperformed their international peers at the task of interpreting media content such as political cartoons. these data suggest that in satisfying its obligation to impart civics knowledge and critical thinking skills the overall u.s. educational system may be performing somewhat better than the systems in place in other democracies.\\nthe naep conclusion that many students are not pro½cient in civics is consistent with the ½nding that the adult population is ignorant of some basic concepts underlying our system of government. for example in the past decade surveys conducted by the annenberg public policy center have found that:\\n• only one-third of americans could name all three branches of government one-third could not name any.\\n• just over a third thought that the founding fathers intended for each branch to hold a lot of power but for the president to have the ½nal say.\\n• just under half of americans 47 percent knew that a 5-4 decision by the supreme court carries the same legal weight as a 9-0 ruling.\\n• almost a third mistakenly believed that a u.s. supreme court ruling could be appealed.\\n• roughly one in four 23 percent believed that when the supreme court divides 5-4 the decision is referred to congress for resolution 16 percent thought it needed to be sent back to the lower courts. 67 one can debate the importance of knowing the name of the chief justice of the supreme court or the details of paul revere\\'s ride but there is little doubt that understanding such foundational concepts as checks and balances and the importance of an independent judiciary affects one\\'s other attitudes. those bewildered by such basics as the branches of government and the concept of judicial review are less likely to express trust in the courts and as trust declines more likely to say that courts are too powerful that judges should be impeached or court jurisdiction stripped when unpopular rulings are issued and that under some circumstances it might simply be best to abolish the supreme court.\\nnot only does civics knowledge predict normatively desirable beliefs about the value of our existing structures of government 68 but heightened knowledge is tied to increased politically relevant activity such as discussing politics and engaging in the community. 69 overall \"[i]nformed citizens are demonstrably better citizens . . . more likely to participate in politics more likely to have meaningful stable attitudes on issues better able to link their interests with their attitudes more likely to choose candidates who are consistent with their own attitudes and more likely to support democratic norms such as extending basic civil liberties to members of unpopular groups.\" 70 as mentioned earlier ½ve hurdles confront those working to improve the quality and accessibility of civic education in the schools: 1 neither the federal government nor the states have made high-quality civics education a priority 2 social studies textbooks may not adequately convey the knowledge or facilitate the development of the skills required of an informed engaged citizenry 3 consequential differences in access and outcomes between upper-and lower-class students persist 4 cutbacks in funding for schools make implementation of changes in any area of the curriculum dif½cult and 5 the polarized political climate increases the likelihood that curricular changes will be cast as advancing a partisan agenda.\\nthere is a widespread belief among social studies educators that \"civic knowledge and inquiry\" are \"not validated\" within the accountability system established by nclb. 71 other evidence underscores the conclusion that neither the federal government nor the states have made high-quality civics education a priority. speci½cally the systematic study of civics in high school is not universal fewer high school civics courses are now offered than in the past the time devoted to teaching the subject in lower grades has been reduced and most states do not require meaningful civics assessment. the 2010 naep found that \"88% of fourth-graders had teachers who reported emphasizing politics and government to a small extent or more in social studies classes.\" 72 just over three-quarters of students said that they had learned about congress in 2010. and slightly fewer than seven in ten twelfth graders reported that they had studied the u.s. constitution in that year. 73 signi½cantly those who have taken a high school civics class are more likely to have a command of key constitutional concepts. 74 however proportionately fewer students are now exposed to multiple civic education courses than in the past. since the generation now in power left high school the number of civics and government courses completed by students has declined. as the guardian of democracy report concludes:\\nuntil the 1960s three courses in civics and government were common in american high schools and two of them \"civics\" and \"problems of democracy\" explored the role of citizens and encouraged students to discuss current issues. today those courses are very rare. what remains is a course on \"american government\" that usually spends little time on how people can-and why they should-participate as citizens. 75 furthermore class time devoted to civic education appears to have declined in the lower grades. 78 on a more encouraging note studies of instructional time spent and credits earned in middle schools and high schools show either the same or increased attention to social studies compared to past decades. 79 however in a climate in which we signal what matters by testing it comparatively few states require meaningful civics assessment. as of 2011 the guardian of democracy report noted that \"only sixteen states require meaningful assessment in the social studies-a number that has declined in the past ½ve years as states have eliminated civics assessments.\" 80 in addition social studies textbooks may not adequately convey the knowledge or facilitate development of the skills required of an informed engaged citizenry. the public as well as parents teachers and administrators agree about the sorts of knowledge that one should gain in public schools. a 2003 annenberg public policy center survey of these groups found that more than half agreed that it is absolutely essential or very important that fourth graders are able to:\\n• understand that the rules of the american government are established in a document called the constitution\\n• give an example of a right protected by the constitution\\n• understand the meaning of american holidays such as the fourth of july and presidents\\' day and\\n• identify important ½gures in american history such as george washington.\\nmore than six in ten respondents concurred that eighth graders should be able to:\\n• understand the idea of separation of powers in american government\\n• identify all ½fty states on a map of the united states\\n• understand the effects of european settlement of the united states on native americans and\\n• understand the role of slavery in the history of the united states.\\nthe same proportions held that twelfth graders should:\\n• understand how immigration has shaped america at different points in history\\n• be able to compare and contrast the u.s. economic system with those of other countries and\\n• know what differentiates a \"liberal\" from a \"conservative\" and understand current american political debates. 81 nonetheless a survey of eighteen u.s. government and civics textbooks concluded in 1987 that their tendency to avoid controversial topics \"made them lifeless descriptions of the origins structures and relationships of government\" 82 a ½nding consistent with the one political scientists richard niemi and jane junn reached a decade later. \"when we say that students have a \\'textbook\\' knowledge of how government operates\" they noted what we mean is that they have a naïve view of it that glosses over the fact that democratic politics is all about disagreement and the attempt to settle quarrels peacefully satisfactorily and in an orderly manner. we believe that it is a disservice to students to let them think that government ideally operates without conflict as if it were possible to enact and administer laws that bene½t everyone and harm no one. 83 in addition to arguing that \"controversial issues should be discussed fairly and explicitly\" the reviewers in that 1987 study recommended that texts change their focus \"from imparting information to preparing students to become concerned citizens.\" students need to learn the value of public participation by becoming involved they concluded. 84 nearly two decades later political theorist stephen macedo and colleagues agreed that schools too often \"teach about citizenship and government without teaching students the skills that are necessary to become active citizens themselves.\" 85 importantly human development scholars judy torney-purta and britt wilkenfeld\\'s 2009 analysis of data from the iea civic education study found that \"[s]tudents who experience interactive discussion-based civic education either by itself or in combination with lecture-based civic education score the highest on the \\'21st century competencies\\' including working with others especially in diverse groups and knowledge of economic and political processes.\" 86 consequential differences in access and outcomes between upper-and lower-class students persist. more worrisome than low levels of aggregate naep scores are indications that students from families of lower socioeconomic status ses have fewer opportunities to engage in activities that stimulate voting and civic engagement and they substantially underperform those from upper ses families.\\nthose high school students who attend \"higher ses schools those who are college-bound and white students get more of these opportunities than low-income students those not heading to college and students of color.\" 87 the twinned side of that reality is represented in the 2010 naep civics assessment\\'s report of signi½cant disparities in scores by family income and parents\\' level of education. whereas at the fourthgrade level only 10 percent of students eligible for free or reduced lunch scored at the pro½cient level and just 40 percent were at a basic or higher level that ½gure rose to 60 percent and 90 percent respectively for those fourth graders not eligible for the lunch program. at the twelfthgrade level students whose parents failed to graduate from high school were signi½-cantly less likely to be pro½cient 8 percent pro½cient/33 percent at least basic than those whose parents graduated from college 40 percent pro½cient/75 percent basic. 88 in practice these disparities translate into a political penalty for the already disadvantaged. 89 as political theorist william galston notes \"[c]itizens with low levels of information cannot follow public discussion of issues are less accepting of the give and take of democratic policy debates make judgments on the basis of character rather than issues and are signi½cantly less inclined to participate in politics at all.\" 90 when a segment of the population does not comprehend the political debate and lacks the wherewithal to affect collective decision-making it forfeits its access to political power a result that makes the political system both less representative of the will of the whole and less democratic. 91 underlying these ½ndings are two realities. given that in general non-anglo students live in economically disadvantaged school districts they have access to a lower quality education overall. 92 and children in higher income families are more likely to live in educationally enriched homes. thus for example \"[i]n the period from 1972 to 1973 high income families spent about $2700 more per year on child enrichment than did lowincome families. by 2005 to 2006 this gap had nearly tripled to $7500.\" 93 as states face the need to balance their budgets in a time of higher-than-average unemployment and lower-than-expected revenues school budgets in k-12 education are experiencing new pressures. it is unlikely that there will be increased funding for underperforming schools or that extra attention will be paid to any content not evaluated by high-stakes tests. in particular as the center on budget policy and priorities reports a majority of u.s. states funded their public elementary and secondary schools at a lower level in 2012 than they had in 2011. 94 all these challenges are of course compounded by the fact that the polarized political climate all but ensures that curricular changes will be cast as advancing a partisan agenda.\\nalthough it is uncontroversial to suggest that civic education is a means of advancing the well-being of the nation and realizing its democratic ideals in recent decades concern has been elicited by low levels of voting and inadequate student performance on civics assessment tests. reformers have responded with efforts both to increase the amount and quality of time spent teaching civic education and to create focused common standards in the social studies. 95 underscoring the importance of these efforts are data associating civics education writ large with increased knowledge of the u.s. system of government and increased participation in democratic activities such as voting. however the challenges confronting these reform efforts are substantial-ranging from reestablishing the centrality of civics education to attempting to institute changes at a time when school budgets are being cut and our political culture is increasingly polarized. as a result any discussion of ways to inculcate civic identity will be controversial.

limit of chronological age. consensus opinion is to evaluate muscle health in terms of muscle mass strength and functional capability. there has been considerable variability in the components of muscle health which have been investigated in addition to variability in the tools of assessment and protocol for measurement. this is in stark contrast to the validated measurement of bone health across the adult life span. the purpose of this review was to identify indices of muscle mass strength and functional capability most responsive to change with ageing and where possible to provide an estimate of the rate of change. we suggest lean tissue mass ltm or skeletal muscle sm is best evaluated from the thigh region due to its greater responsiveness to ageing compared to the whole body. the anterior compartment of the thigh region undergoes a preferential age-related decline in sm and force generating capacity. therefore we suggest that knee extensor torque is measured to represent the force generating capacity of the thigh and subsequently to express muscle quality strength per unit tissue. finally we suggest measures of functional capability which allow participants perform to a greater maximum are most appropriate to track age-related difference in functional capacity across the adult lifespan. this is due to their ability encompass a broad spectrum of abilities. this

sea-level rise increases the vulnerability of coastal communities to flooding associated with coastal storms. the case study applies a gis-based methodology to assess the vulnerability of cape may county new jersey to flood hazards caused by both riverine flooding and coastal storm surges. for storm events of differing intensities it first identifies areas that will be inundated and how they will change with projected sea-level rise. it then assesses the social vulnerability of the county taking into account factors such as age gender race income and housing conditions. finally it combines physical and social vulnerabilities to create a picture of the county's present overall vulnerability as well as how this will change with projected sea-level rise. to account for uncertainties in projections possible ranges of both population growth and sea-level rise are incorporated in low medium and high scenarios. the results show that sea-level rise will increase the vulnerability of the county to flood hazards considerably by increasing the areas that are exposed to the highest flood risk hence increasing the number of critical facilities properties and people to the risk of flooding. comparing the upper-and lower-bound scenarios indicates that poorly managed development could increase the county's vulnerability to flooding. these results suggest that decision-makers could reduce vulnerability by making choices that steer development away from highrisk areas. \", '56104488-2263-498c-8c8d-4fdb78c20ce1': 'abstract methodologists have criticized the

studies suggest that elevated leukocyte count within the normal range can predict cardiovascular and total mortality in older adults. these findings are remarkable because this simple and common laboratory test is included in routine medical check-ups. it is well known that chronic systemic inflammation inflammaging is one of the hallmarks of aging and an important component of obesity-associated insulin resistance that can lead to type 2 diabetes and other health problems in both overweight individuals and elderly people. to understand the molecular mechanisms linking increased systemic inflammation with aging-associated diseases and elevated leukocyte counts in the elderly is to unravel the multiplicity of molecular factors and mechanisms involved in chronic low-grade systemic inflammation the gradual accumulation of random molecular damage age-related diseases and the process of leukopoiesis. there are several possible mechanisms through which chronic low-grade systemic inflammation is associated with both higher leukocyte count and a greater risk of aging-associated conditions in older adults. for example the il-6 centric model predicts that this biomediator is involved in chronic systemic inflammation and leukopoiesis thereby suggesting that elevated leukocyte count is a signal of poor health in older adults. alternatively an increase in neutrophil and monocyte counts can be a direct cause of cardiovascular events in the elderly. interestingly some authors assert that the predictive ability of elevated leukocyte counts with regard to cardiovascular and allcause mortality among older adults surpass the predictive value of total cholesterol. this review reports the recent findings on the links between elevated but normal leukocyte counts and the increased risks of all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality. the possible molecular mechanisms linking higher but normal leukocyte counts with increased risk of aging-associated

type 2 diabetes t2d and coronary heart disease chd share many clinical and lifestyle risk factors and several biomarkers are associated with both diseases. the current analysis aims to assess the relevance of biomarkers combined to pathway groups for the development of t2d and chd in the same cohort.\\nmethods: forty-seven serum biomarkers were measured in the monica/kora case-cohort study using clinical chemistry assays and ultrasensitive molecular counting technology. the t2d chd analyses included 689 568 incident cases and 1850 2004 non-cases from three population-based surveys. at baseline the study participants were 35-74 years old. the median follow-up was 14 years. we computed cox regression models for each biomarker adjusted for age sex and survey. additionally we assigned the biomarkers to 19 etiological pathways based on information from literature. one age- sex- and survey-controlled average variable was built for each pathway. we used the r 2 pm coefficient of determination to assess the explained disease risk. results: the associations of many biomarkers such as several cytokines or the iron marker soluble transferrin receptor stfr were similar in strength for t2d and chd but we also observed important differences. lipoprotein a lpa and n-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide nt-probnp even demonstrated opposite effect directions. all pathway variables together explained 49% of the t2d risk and 21% of the chd risk. the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 igfbp-2 igf/igfbp system pathway best explained the t2d risk about 9% explained risk independent of all other pathway variables. for chd the myocardial-injury-and lipid-related-pathways were most important and both explained about 4% of the chd risk.\\nthe biomarker-derived pathway variables explained a higher proportion of the t2d risk compared to chd. the ranking of the pathways differed between the two diseases with the igf/igfbp-system-pathway being most strongly associated with t2d and the myocardial-injury-and lipid-related-pathways with chd. our results help to better understand the pathophysiology of the two diseases with the ultimate goal of pointing out targets for lifestyle intervention and drug development to ideally prevent both t2d and chd development.\\n© the authors 2020. this article is licensed under a creative commons

'introduction t he last decade has seen a surge in empirical research by economists addressing the impact of school reform policies. this wave of research dates back to card and krueger 1992 and a series of analyses that look across the united states to test the effects of school inputs on outcomes such as achievement educational attainment and earnings. many of these studies use either census data heckman layne-farrar and todd 1996 or national longitudinal surveys betts 1996 loeb and bound 1996 grogger 1996 to estimate input effects. since then much of the research has turned from the nation to states and cities using local administrative and experimental data to focus on specific policy initiatives. 1 the shift in emphasis from the national to the local has enabled researchers to incorporate greater institutional and policy detail into their analyses. local data often follow individuals over time allowing researchers to use empirical techniques not possible with pooled cross-sectional census data. at the same time the administrative data provide deep coverage of local areas which national surveys that sample only a small portion of any locality do not. while local administrative data provide advantages over census and survey data for estimating the causal effects of some policies experimental data alleviate the perennial concern that correlational analyses have not established causality. however experiments are not easy to implement in education they can\\'t be used to address all types of education policy and they tend to be too small to elicit the responses generated by large-scale reforms.\\nas data have improved and studies have proliferated the recent literature is more characterized by seemingly inconsistent results than by increased consensus over the impact of education policy reforms. estimates of the impact of similar policies across analyses datasets and localities often vary. for example there appear to be inconclusive results surrounding the impact of class size on student achievement. hoxby 2000a finds no effect while angrist and lavy 1999  who use similar techniques but different data find positive effects of smaller classes as do krueger 1997 and hanushek 1999 in their studies of the tennessee star experiment. some of the variation in the estimates may be due to inadequate statistical techniques as each type of data and empirical approach has its own weaknesses and no approach has been able to overcome all concerns. yet much of the variation may not stem from econometric error but instead from heterogeneity of policies from the influence of local conditions on policy effects and/or from the differential effects of a single policy on heterogeneous individuals. the answer to whether a policy improves student learning may not be a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" instead the answer is likely to depend on the context in which the policy is implemented the scale of the reform and the characteristics of the students in question. as a result it is worth considering the findings individually and working to create a structure that allows for differences in context and that can be used to understand complex effects of policy reforms.\\nthis paper reviews recent innovations in data usage in empirical studies of education policy effects concentrating on large administrative data collection efforts and experiments. it then summarizes a number of the findings in three areas of education policy that have been the focus of recent research and debate: school finance accountability and choice. although there have been fundamental reforms in education policy at both the preschool and higher education levels this paper focuses on elementary and secondary education policy paying special attention to the types of data used and the impact of the empirical approach on the findings.\\n2 data recent research in education finance is characterized by the use of a wide range of data types including national longitudinal surveys census data state and city administrative datasets and experimental data. each type of data has clear advantages and disadvantages. for example while census data provide national coverage and a large sample size they lack the detail that can be obtained through smaller national surveys. census data do not follow individuals over time though they can be used to follow jurisdictions such as school districts counties or states. state and city administrative data often do provide detail on schools and individuals and can trace them over time but only within that city or state making it difficult to extrapolate the findings to other locations. only experiments are designed specifically to determine causality however they are difficult to implement effectively and are often limited in scope. below we outline briefly the different sources of data and further advantages and disadvantages of each.', '644c56e6-9b69-434f-8a78-48fd6757dd12':

examine patterns of sorting across classrooms within schools in three large urban school districts. although the literatures on tracking and segregation are vast few studies have examined sorting of students within schools with the level of detailed data that we use in this study. we address three research questions. first to what extent are students sorted across classrooms within schools along the lines of race and ethnicity poverty status and prior achievement? second does the extent to which within school sorting occurs vary across grade levels? third to what extent can sorting by race and ethnicity and poverty level be explained by differences in prior achievement? we find some evidence of sorting by student race and poverty status across classrooms at all grade levels some but not all of which is accounted for by differences in prior achievement. sorting within schools is smaller than sorting across schools but within-school sorting is nontrivial particularly at the middle and high school levels. we also find that students are sorted by their prior achievement across classrooms within schools even in self-contained elementary school classrooms. classes made up of lower

of elderly individuals with t2dm the number of diabetic patients with cognitive dysfunction has been increasing. t2dm may accelerate ad-associated pathologies through insulin resistance. vascular

of disease and prognoses of these broad groups appeared to be different. this form of classification was adopted by both the american rheumatism association in 1977 [6] and the who/eular in 1978 [7] . unfortunately these classifications were not exactly identical creating a schism in nomenclature reviewed in [8] .\\nuntil 1975 expertise in treating these children in the uk was developed at one centre: the canadian red cross hospital. subsequent to the retirement of its director the mrc rheumatism unit was closed and dr ansell started peripatetic clinics with local physicians within the uk as well as maintaining a national unit at the mrc clinical research centre at northwick park hospital in harrow. the british paediatric rheumatology group bprg consisting of 10 founder members was established in 1985 affiliated to the british paediatric association. a european organization for paediatric rheumatology was also founded in 1979: the 'eular standing committee for paediatric rheumatology'. parallel developments also occurred in the usa and the first international conference was held in park city in 1977. the european committee has an important function by allowing the sharing of clinical experiences leading to new syndromes and new clinical entities being described. one of these was the chronic infantile neurological cutaneous articular syndrome cinca as coined by dr prieur from paris concurrently described by dr ansell in the uk and dr lovell in the usa [9] . the various clinical manifestations of vasculitides in childhood have also been recognized during the period up to 1985.\\nbetween 1975 and 1985 collaborative clinical research within the uk and with its european partners was carried out on the management of juvenile chronic arthritis jca. more basic research was in the areas of genetics amyloidosis and growth retardation. in the area of therapeutics considerable advances have been made in terms of the number of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can be used as a result of comparative or double-blind placebo-controlled studies reviewed in [10] . with regard to second-line drug therapy however results were less hopeful up until 1985. the largest comparative study of second-line agents was performed between the usa and ussr collaborative study group. they showed that hydroxychloroquine auranofin and penicillamine were no better than placebo in the treatment of polyarthritis [11 12] . a review in the uk showed that the outcome of amyloidosis was significantly improved by chlorambucil [13] fig. 1  but there is an increase of leukaemia demands on their time. at the beginning of this decade two paediatric rheumatologists were appointed funded by the academic sector. both elected to concentrate on practising only paediatric rheumatology allied to a programme of research. at the beginning of this decade there was no health service appointment of paediatric rheumatologists as paediatric rheumatology was not recognized as a speciality. the need for services was unrecognized at all levels and there were a few parent support groups attached to individual clinics. as there was no speciality recognition there were no trainees in paediatric rheumatology. in contrast over the last decade the membership of the bprg has grown from 10 to over 100 consisting of consultants trainees and allied health professionals. a national parent support group the children's chronic arthritis association with a current membership of over 400 was formed with regional representatives and hotlines. in 1994 the british paediatric association working party published a report on paediatric rheumatology defining the problems the diseases the burden on the health service and the service provision that was required as well as the need for paediatric rheumatology research. paediatric rheumatology was given academic recognition when i was appointed as the first professor of paediatric rheumatology at london university in 1994 and moved the national referral unit to a more permanent home at great ormond street hospital. the recognition of the speciality by the royal college for training in may 1995 was a crucial step to providing an important infrastructure so that paediatric rheumatology services can be provided across the uk and also paediatric rheumatology research could flourish. in 1996 a new syllabus for training was produced just in time for the revision of the whole of specialist training according to calman recommendations. now specialist paediatric rheumatology registrars have been appointed in two centres.\\nover the last year there has been increased collaboration between paediatric rheumatologists from north america and europe leading to a number of important international milestones. in 1994 a task force in paediatric rheumatology was convened by who/ilar to consider the classification of the idiopathic arthritides in childhood. prior to this a number of articles had been published on the need for re-classification reviewed in [16] . the result is a proposed revised classification which is currently being validated [17] . the next important milestone of international collaboration was the juvenile arthritis component of the international hla workshop in 1996. over 2000 samples were collected. this was another impetus for us in the uk to optimize our resources and the laboratory at the arc epidemiology unit in manchester undertook the hla typing and storage of all dna from jca patients around the uk provided by bprg members. the third important milestone of international collaboration was in may of 1996. a consensus conference on core outcome measures for therapeutic trials in juvenile chronic arthritis was convened in pavia under the leadership of from this treatment. basic research has shown that the amyloid fibre is formed from polymers of an acute-phase protein serum amyloid a and that in the deposit there are a number of other molecules such as serum amyloid p component and glycosaminoglycans reviewed in [14] .\\nas far as epidemiological studies are concerned these were in their infancy and there were a number of studies performed in northern american and european countries up to that point giving an incidence of jca of 1.3-18.2/100 000.\\nan early twin study was incomplete due to lack of numbers but highlighted that hla-b27 was a marker hla association with different subgroups of jca in part supporting the broad classification but revealing heterogeneity and overlapping groups. there are also ethnic and regional differences. the main problem of most of these studies is that the numbers are not sufficiently large for definitive statements to be made.\\nin the field of growth retardation the complication of steroid therapy was noted in the 1970s and alteration of the administration regimen of corticosteroids to maximize growth was advocated. however the disease could cause growth retardation as described by cornil and still. low levels of somatomedin [insulin growth factors igfs] were reported [15]  but the results were controversial and varied between different studies due to assay difficulties.\\nthe above is a

t ft shbg lh fsh and prolactin prl in 103 type 2 diabetes patients. ft was measured by equilibrium dialysis. ft was also calculated by using t and shbg cft. hypogonadism was defined as low ft or cft. the mean age was 54.7 ؎ 1.1 yr mean body mass index  t ype 2 diabetes is associated with low total testosterone t in cross-sectional studies 1-8. barrett-connor 1 in the rancho bernardo study demonstrated that the 44 elderly men mean age 72 yr with type 2 diabetes had lower total t levels than age-and body mass index bmi-matched nondiabetics. prediabetes was also associated with lower levels of total t and bioavailable t bt in the rancho bernardo study 3. another population-based case control study conducted in new caledonia caldia survey found lower total t levels in 16 european and 77 melanesian men with type 2 diabetes compared with an equal number of controls 6. andersson et al. 7 reported lower total t and shbg levels in 46 diabetics compared with 11 healthy men of similar bmi and age.\\ntotal t concentrations are determined to a large extent by circulating shbg concentrations. in the blood of normal men 44% of total t is bound to shbg 2% is unbound [free t ft] and 54% circulates bound to albumin and other proteins 9. because albumin-bound t has 1000 times lower affinity than shbg it can freely disassociate in capillaries. virtually all the non-shbg-bound t also called bt is therefore available for tissue uptake 10. circulating shbg concentrations are also dependent upon a number of factors the most important association being with obesity. shbg levels decrease in obesity and increase with aging. type 2 diabetics have even lower shbg levels compared with age-and bmimatched nondiabetics 2.\\na complete assessment of hypogonadism should therefore include measurement of ft. ft levels were low in diabetics in the caldia study 6. however the ft was measured by ria a method that is now considered unreliable because it represents a variable fraction 20 -60% of the ft measured by equilibrium dialysis ed 11-13. the purpose of ft and bt is to correct the total testosterone concentration for the effect of variable binding with shbg. winters et al. 14 found that shbg is an important determinant of ft measured by analog ria in men. furthermore ria measures a constant percentage of total testosterone 0.5-0.65%.\\ned is considered to be the gold standard for measuring ft. ft measured by this technique represents 1.5-4% of total t and is not dependent upon shbg concentrations 14. to our knowledge no study has compared ft levels done by ed in diabetics and nondiabetics. the probable reason for this is that ed is a delicate tedious and time-consuming technique and therefore not suitable for population-based or large studies. it is therefore not clear whether the lower shbg levels in diabetics can account for all the differences in t levels between diabetics and nondiabetics.\\nit is also not known whether the lower t levels in diabetics are associated with changes in lh and fsh. we have previously published data showing that the commonest form of gonadal dysfunction associated with type 2 diabetics with erectile dysfunction is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 15. ando et al. 5 reported low total t and normal lh levels in diabetics whereas ali et al. 16 found that subjects with diabetic neuropathy had low t and high lh and

academic achievement and behavior of adolescents fan and chen 2001 jeynes 2016 . this brief study aims to promote the development of children and adolescents by examining the relationship between parental involvement socioeconomic status ses and junior school students' performance e.g. academic achievement and school behavior. a survey that took a national representative sample for china was considered in this work.\\nparental involvement generally includes three aspects: home-based involvement school-based involvement and academic socialization fan and chen 2001 hill and chao 2009 hill and tyson 2009 . home-based involvement entails parents' involvement activities at home such as supervising homework checking homework and talking about school life school-based involvement includes some activities implemented at school such as communicating with teachers attending the class meeting and participating in school activities academic socialization mainly includes parents' expectations and faith about their children's education hill and tyson 2009 benner et al. 2016 . this framework was usually used in american culture wang and sheikh-khalil 2014 . for example using data for 15240 middle school students in america benner et al. 2016 tested the relationship between parental involvement i.e. home-based involvement school-based involvement and academic socialization and academic achievement. with the american data of education longitudinal study 2002 -2013  day and dotterer 2018 assessed the connection between parental involvement i.e. home-and school-based involvement and academic socialization and academic achievement. however such framework should be modified in the chinese context lau et al. 2011 . by using a data of 310 kindergartens elementary schools and secondary schools from home-school cooperation committee of the education department in hong kong ng 1999 found that chinese parents didn't like to get involved in school and teachers didn't like to get parents involved in school either. using a sample of 431 students in hong kong lau et al. 2011 demonstrated that when compared with homebased involvement school-based involvement had less influence on children's educational performance. in interviews with 30 migrant children mean age = 13 in zhejiang china fang et al. 2017 found that school-based involvement was less mentioned. in this case the current studies only focus on homebased involvement and academic socialization in the chinese context. previous studies have demonstrated that home-based involvement and academic socialization positively influenced academic achievement and school behavior fan and chen 2001 chen and gregory 2009 hill and tyson 2009 benner et al. 2016 . for example manz et al. 2014 found that a mother's home-based involvement increased children's interpersonal skills and decreased the incidence of negative classroom behaviors. hayes 2012 found that home-based involvement increased adolescents' academic achievement. hill and tyson 2009 further claimed that academic socialization was positively related to academic achievement.\\nnevertheless socioeconomic status significantly affects the relationship between parental involvement and adolescent performance stevenson and baker 1987 byun et al. 2012 . parents with low ses typically practice low levels of academic socialization with their children carolan and wasserman 2015 . by contrast families with high ses usually engage in high-quality activities of home-based involvement fantuzzo et al. 2004 . for instance conger and donnellan 2007 found that parents with high ses had better communication with their children. in an expansion study on children's communicative-pragmatic ability with a sample of 390 italian-speaking children bosco et al. 2013 found that family ses has small yet significant positive effect on children's pragmatic ability and the effect was still existed during the middle part of their childhood. in addition other studies suggested that ses is linked with the academic achievement of adolescents hill and tyson 2009 byun et al. 2012 . adolescents from families with high ses tend to display good academic achievement sirin 2005 reardon 2011 .\\naccording to the theory of cultural reproduction a high ses family provides more educational resources to their offspring and promotes adolescents' educational achievement bourdieu 1973 bourdieu and passeron 1990 . coleman 1988 considered that a family with high ses can provide a better living environment and more educational resources for their child or children. for example with a longitudinal data of 2744 adolescents morris et al. 2018 found that children from low ses families tended to live in low ses neighborhoods causing a higher tendency for them to take up smoking. with the independent freshman admission administrative data from an elite university i.e. peking university in china liu et al. 2014 found that adolescents in high ses families had more chances to pass the selection process to enter these universities. in such circumstances with less social capital parental involvement is more important for adolescents in low ses families. according to the cultural mobility model dimaggio 1982 argued that a low ses environment acted as an incentive for parents to invest in their children to make up for other factors that disadvantaged them. parental involvement acts as a support mechanism for children whereas adolescents in high ses families had better living conditions and more educational resources. this meant that the effect of parental involvement was greatly reduced. thus parental involvement is more effective for adolescents in low ses families than for adolescents in high ses families.\\nthe preceding literature review implies that the moderating role of ses varies among different aspects of parental involvement i.e. home-based involvement and academic socialization and adolescent school performance i.e. academic achievement and school behavior. for instance with the data taken from national education longitudinal study 88-94 kim and schneider 2005 further claimed that adolescents from low-ses families benefited more from parental involvement in academic activities. with the data from the national longitudinal survey of youth-children and young adults in america jaeger 2011 found that socioeconomic status played a moderating role in the relationship between cultural capital which contained partial content of parental involvement and adolescent academic achievement. using data from 10 public high schools in america wang and sheikh-khalil 2014 found that home-based involvement was more strongly correlated with school academic behavior in low-ses families. however both wang and sheikh-khalil 2014 and jaeger 2011 tested the moderation effect of family ses in the american context. yet few studies have tested the moderating effect of ses between parental involvement and adolescent performance in other specific culture such as in the chinese culture.\\nas a result we hypothesize that socioeconomic status negatively moderates the relationship between parental involvement and junior school students' performance in the chinese context. data from china education panel study of 2013-2014 would be used to validate this hypothesis. the meaning of the current study may be as follows. first the current study highlights the importance of parental involvement and may serve to upgrade the importance of family education in china. second the current study can be regarded as a suggestion for a family intervention project to focus on promoting parental involvement.\", '6f677121-0067-4cfe-8a0e-7cef413df6d3':

flexible. for example the effects of variables including the latent time-invariant variable might change over time. the latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others. lagged endogenous variables might be necessary. alternatives that move beyond the classic fem and rem models are known but they involve estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare. this article presents a general panel model that includes the standard fem and rem as special cases. in addition it provides a sequence of nested models that

published march 8 2007 doi:10.1152/japplphysiol.01322.2006.-genetic variation in myostatin a negative regulator of skeletal muscle in cattle has shown remarkable influence on skeletal muscle resulting in a double-muscled phenotype in certain breeds however dna sequence variation within this gene in humans has not been consistently associated with skeletal muscle mass or strength. follistatin and activin-type ii receptor b acvr2b are two myostatin-related genes involved in the regulation and signaling of myostatin. we sought to identify associations between genetic variation and haplotype structure in both follistatin and acvr2b with skeletal muscle-related phenotypes. three hundred fifteen men and 278 women aged 19 -90 yr from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging were genotyped to determine respective haplotype groupings hap groups based on hapmap data. whole body soft tissue composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. quadriceps peak torque strength was measured using an isokinetic dynamometer. women carriers of acvr2b hap group 1 exhibited significantly less quadriceps muscle strength shortening phase than women homozygous for hap group 2 109.2 ϯ

than noncarriers 16.6 ϯ 0.3 vs. 17.5 ϯ 0.2 kg respectively p ϭ 0.012. no significant associations between these haplotype groups were observed in women. these results indicate that haplotype structure at the acvr2b and follistatin loci may contribute to interindividual variation in skeletal muscle mass and strength although these data indicate sex-specific relationships.\\ngenetics skeletal muscle sex differences in muscle mass and strength among individuals are due to both environmental and genetic factors. muscle mass and strength are highly heritable phenotypes with genetic factors contributing significantly to the variation in lean body mass and muscle strength. for example huygens et al. 13 reported that heritable factors accounted for up to 90% of the interindividual variation in muscle mass and ϳ60% in strength while seeman et al. 27 estimated the genetic component of lean body mass explained 80% of the total variance. despite the strong evidence for the importance of genetic factors in regulating muscle phenotypes the identification of specific genes and allelic variants contributing to these phenotypes is in its infancy and few specific genes have been identified as contributing factors 30.\\ndespite its relatively short history myostatin has quickly become a prime candidate to study as a mechanism of muscle development and as a potential therapy for muscle-related disorders. first reported in 1997 by mcpherron et al. 23 myostatin growth and differentiation factor-8 was identified in mice as a transforming growth factor-␤ tgf-␤ family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. soon after the initial report of myostatin\\'s discovery several groups identified mutations in the myostatin gene in naturally bred \"double-muscled\" cattle breeds 10 24 providing additional evidence for a critical role for myostatin in muscle development.\\nfollowing up their initial discovery lee and mcpherron 17 established putative myostatin receptors activin-type ii receptors a and b acvr2a and acvr2b and negative regulators the myostatin propeptide and follistatin and formalized a basic model of myostatin regulation. with the identification of acvr2b as the primary myostatin receptor and the myostatin propeptide 32 39 and follistatin as negative regulators of myostatin activity lee and mcpherron 17 put forth a model in which the myostatin cooh-terminal dimer remains in a latent complex with the inhibitory propeptide. this latent complex can be further negatively regulated by binding with follistatin and on release of the negative regulators myostatin is free to signal through its receptors primarily acvr2b. lee and mcpherron 17 demonstrated that myostatin binding to acvr2b receptors was specific and saturable. they also demonstrated increased muscle expression of a dominant negative form of acvr2b increased muscle weights up to 125% more than those of control animals.\\nseveral studies have shown that follistatin can function as a potent myostatin antagonist and plays an important role in vivo. first follistatin is capable of blocking myostatin activity in both receptor binding and reporter gene assays 17 40 . second genetic studies in mice have shown that overexpression of follistatin in muscle can cause dramatic increases in muscle growth. lee and mcpherron 17 generated transgenic mice in which the myosin light chain promoter/enhancer was used to drive the expression of follistatin and muscle weights were increased by 194 -327% relative to control animals. thus follistatin appears to be a potent myostatin antagonist 17.\\ndespite the remarkable influence of myostatin on skeletal muscle and the well-established effect of myostatin gene mutations in double-muscled cattle breeds

contains all necessary information to describe how all of these quantities change over time. the nsrs is crucial for meeting our nation's economic social and environmental needs.\\nngs recognized the potential contributions of the global positioning system ͑gps͒ for enhancing the nsrs in the early stages of gps development. hence in the late 1980s this agency embarked on applying gps instrumentation and field techniques to improve the nsrs. ngs quickly converted its traditional horizontal field operations ͑which applied line-of-sight instruments͒ to three-dimensional ͑3d͒ field operations using gps instrumentation. snay ͑1989͒ reported that traditional line-of-sight techniques provided positional coordinates with relative accuracies of approximately 1:250000 among the primary horizontal reference stations in the nsrs. gps on the other hand easily yields relative accuracies exceeding 1:1000000. in addition because of the line-of-sight requirement many of the older reference stations had been installed in locations like mountain tops which are difficult to access.\\nngs first applied gps to determine positional coordinates for the brass disks and other monuments that served as traditional reference stations. starting with tennessee in 1987 ngs collaborated with various state and federal agencies and others to establish a high accuracy reference network ͑harn͒-also called a high precision geodetic network-in each of the 50 states. for each harn survey many new reference marks were positioned so that as compared to the preexisting reference marks the new ones would be located in more accessible places ͑e.g. near public roads͒ and/or they would provide a relatively less obstructed view of the sky. these statewide harns were embedded into a more accurate sparse nationwide network whose points were also positioned using gps techniques first in 1987 and again in 1990. once a harn survey was completed in a particular state ngs performed a statewide readjustment of the harn data together with all archived classical geodetic surveys and local gps projects performed in that state to compute consistent positional coordinates for the associated ground marks.\\nanticipating the need to perform accurate harn surveys ngs introduced in the fall of 1986 the cooperative international gps network ͑cignet͒ ͑chin et al. 1987͒ the

education. most studies have attempted to determine whether bourdieu's notion of social reproduction based on the intergenerational transmission of cultural capital is valid and if so the role that the educational system plays. however by focusing on cultural capital these studies have ignored another crucial component of bourdieu's theoretical model of practice: habitus. habitus or one's view of the world and one's place in it is an important consideration in trying to understand how students navigate their way through the educational system. studying cultural capital while ignoring habitus leaves bourdieu's theoretical framework incomplete in its practical application. it is necessary to consider both one's resources capital and the orientation one has toward using those resources habitus to implement the model of practice in the educational field in the way that bourdieu intended.\\nit is particularly important to consider the functions of both cultural capital and habitus when studying gender differences in schooling. jacobs 1996 noted that much of the mainstream research in the sociology of education tends to ignore women even though gender is one of the main stratifying factors in society. bourdieu has been criticized for giving short shrift to factors other than class that distinguish people from one another hall 1992 .1 indeed many of bourdieu's works imply that gender is a secondary characteristic to social class.2 recent research has considered other stratifying factors by addressing the role of race in addition to class in relation to cultural capital farkas 1996 farkas et al. 1990  kalmijn and kraaykamp 1996 lareau and horvat 1999. gender however has been a neglected area even though boys and girls have different experiences in the schooling system that may lead to their different positions in society. although one may argue that boys and girls receive the same cultural training if they are in the same social class their habitus may be quite different on the basis of their socialization and the views they form of the opportunity structure available to them. for example while both male and female students choose business over any other college major women are less likely than men to get degrees in engineering the physical sciences and computer science all of which have been traditionally seen as male disciplines yupin et al. 2000 .3 jacobs 1995 noted that 30 percent of women would have to change their college majors for women to be distributed in the same manner as men. moreover jacobs 1996 showed that at every level of education women earn less than men for example when both women and men have four years of college women earn .71 of what men earn. thus despite advances for women over the past few decades there are many structural constraints to women's progress and gender socialization continues to shape girls' lives.\\neven with these obstacles female students excel in school they repeat grades less often do than male students have higher graduation rates from high school and are more likely to attain bachelor's degrees jacobs 1996 . this puzzle was addressed by mickelson 1989  who noted that female students' achievement in school seems anomalous because the rewards associated with schooling are still lower than those for male students. determining the effects of both habitus and cultural capital on students' grades will help sociologists understand this problem.\\nthe goals of this article are to join cultural capital and habitus in a model of educational success as bourdieu intended to determine whether cultural capital and habitus play significant roles in educational success and more specifically to determine whether one's gender in addition to one's socioeconomic status ses leads to different benefits from cultural capital and habitus in terms of educational outcomes. the following two sections set up the theoretical framework for the article. first bourdieu's broader theoretical framework including his notions of habitus field and practice is discussed and gender is placed within this theoretical framework. 46 \", '7874a612-acb9-4d1d-b317-2c3adfe260b3': 'abstract previous in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging mri-based studies of age-related differences in the human brainstem have focused on volumetric morphometry. these investigations have provided pivotal

changes in the brain. these studies have largely focused on the cerebrum with very few mr investigations addressing age-dependent differences in the brainstem in spite of its central role in the regulation of vital functions. several studies indicate early brainstem alterations in a myriad of neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. the paucity of mr-focused investigations is likely due in part to the challenges imposed by the small structural scale of the brainstem itself as well as of substructures within requiring accurate high spatial resolution imaging studies. in this work we

for the possibility that immigrant and native teachers may be assigned to different types of schools and even within schools to different types of students two estimation strategies are employed. the first estimates the immigrant teacher impact by comparing the achievements of students with immigrant teachers to the achievements of observationally similar students with native teachers within

that overall immigrant teachers do not have a negative impact on the educational achievements of native students. additional tests suggest that this non-adverse effect is due to the greater

misleading overly optimistic estimates of aging changes. methods and results-to determine longitudinal rate of change in aerobic capacity and the influence of age gender and physical activity on these changes we performed serial measurements of peak treadmill oxygen consumption peak v o 2  in 375 women and 435 men ages 21 to 87 years from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging a community-dwelling cohort free of clinical heart disease over a median follow-up period of 7.9 years. a linear mixed-effects regression model was used to calculate the predicted longitudinal 10-year rate of change in peak v o 2  expressed in milliliters per minute for each age decade from the 20s through the 70s after adjustment for self-reported leisure-time physical activity. a longitudinal decline in peak v o 2 was observed in each of the 6 age decades in both sexes however the rate of decline accelerated from 3% to 6% per 10 years in the 20s and 30s to ͼ20% per 10 years in the 70s and beyond. the rate of decline for each decade was larger in men than in women from the 40s onward. similar longitudinal rates of decline prevailed when peak v o 2 was indexed per kilogram of body weight or per kilogram of fat-free mass and in all quartiles of self-reported leisure-time physical activity. when the components of peak v o 2 were examined the rate of longitudinal decline of the oxygen pulse ie the o 2 utilization per heart beat mirrored that of peak v o 2  whereas the longitudinal rate of heart rate decline averaged only 4% to 6% per 10 years and accelerated only minimally with

the nels are likely to be biased. although nels has several important limitations the data set provides detailed information on family background and school characteristics for a large nationally representative sample of students and is arguably one of the best available data sources for estimating education production functions. evidence that value-added models are not unbiased when applied to the nels raises questions about the validity of previous valueadded studies that rely on less detailed data sets and perhaps suggests that less weight should be given to the value-added literature

do value-added or other estimation approaches which suggests that the biases identified by our nels empirical work are large enough to be of substantive importance. we conclude by noting that because most of the iv estimates are fairly modest in size it is not obvious that increased school spending is the most cost-effective way to improve the skills of students. education production function

a 4d longitudinal fashion. however the previous methods were either limited by using application specified energy function e.g. surface fusion and multi model fusion or only considered temporal smoothness on two consecutive time points t and t+1 under sparsity assumption. therefore a 4d multi-atlas label fusion theory for general label fusion purpose and simultaneously considering temporal

lymphoblasts [lesch et al. 1996] . in a sample of 505 individuals lesch et al. [1996] found that the neo-pi-r neuroticism was significantly associated with the 5-httlpr: individuals with the ss or sl genotypes had higher scores on neuroticism than individuals with the ll genotype. lesch et al. estimated that the polymorphism accounted for 3-4% of total variation and 7-9% of inherited variance of anxiety-related personality traits. although the mechanism of action of the ssris are complex and do not simply fit hypotheses such as the ''serotonin depletion'' for depression [lacasse and leo 2005]  the association between the less active s allele and neuroticism remains counterintuitive [lesch et al. 1996 arbelle et al. 2003  but see ansorge et al. 2004] . given that the ssri therapeutic action is through blocking reuptake of serotonin one would expect the less efficient s allele which presumably reuptakes less serotonin to be associated with lower neuroticism.\\nfurthermore the original report was replicated in a number of later studies [ricketts et al. 1998 murakami et al. 1999 greenberg et al. 2000 sen et al. 2004b]  but others failed to find an association using general population [ball et al. 1997 ebstein et al. 1997 jorm et al. 1998 herbst et al. 2000 willis-owen et al. 2005 middeldorp et al. 2007 munafo et al. 2008b] or clinical samples [gelernter et al. 1998 mazzanti et al. 1998 ] and some found an association in the opposite direction [jorm et al. 2000 van gestel et al. 2002 arbelle et al. 2003 brummett et al. 2003 ]. inconsistent findings have been attributed to the use of admixed populations but the true impact of population stratification in the field of molecular psychiatry is questionable [hutchison et al. 2004 gardner et al. 2008] . several meta-analyses have summarized the results [sen et al. 2004a schinka et al. 2004 munafo et al. 2008b]  and found no association when considering the entire set of studies. however the choice of personality scale used was a significant moderating variable: in studies that used the neuroticism scale of the neo-pi-r a small d $ 0.2 but statistically significant effect was found. no effect was found when personality was assessed using the harm avoidance scale of the tci or the neuroticism scale of the epq. another meta-analyses [munafo et al. 2005a] reported a moderating effect in the opposite direction but this might be due to coding errors [munafo et al. 2005b] .\\nthe results of meta-analyses should be considered with caution because of the uncontrolled differences among studies publication biases unknown moderating variables and other confounding factors. as argued by munafo et al. [2005b] ''meta-analyses are therefore by no means perfect [. . .] . very large well-designed primary studies remain the most reliable way of obtaining reproducible results.'' to date the only large studies $4000 subjects well-powered to detect small genetic effect did not support the hypothesis that the 5-httlpr is associated with neuroticism as measured with the epq [willis-owen et al. 2005]  or harm avoidance [munafo et al. 2008b] . however it is possible that when the phenotype is assessed with the neo-pi-r an association between the 5-httlpr and neuroticism could be found. to address this hypothesis we examined in a large sample $4000 subjects whether personality traits assessed with the neo-pi-r are associated with the 5-httlpr and other variants in the serotonin transporter gene. this sample is part of the sardinia project [pilia et al. 2006]  a multidisciplinary study that assessed multiple traits and performed a genome-wide association scan in a homogeneous sample from a founder population. furthermore we tested the association of the 5-httlpr and other variants in a sample from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging blsa. in the blsa most subjects have been assessed with the neo-pi-r at multiple visits. longitudinal studies have shown that the use of multiple measures yields larger estimates of heritability compared to studies based on single report [kendler et al. 1993 riemann et al. 1997] . aggregating data across multiple occasions should produce more robust results less dependent on state-specific effects. although the blsa sample with 5-httlpr genotype is relatively small the sample size of 548 individuals has a power higher than 0.80 at significance level p ¼ 0.01 two-tailed to detect the differences on neuroticism reported in recent meta-analyses d $ 0.2 [schinka et al. 2004 sen et al. 2004a munafo et al. 2008b] . in addition to the 5-httlpr in both samples we examine a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms snps that map in the slc6a4 gene region for association with the neuroticism related traits. these snps have not been routinely examined in previous studies and most are not in linkage disequilibrium with the 5-httlpr thus providing independent association tests of other 5-htt gene regions with neuroticism-related traits [strug et al. 2008] .\", '99cd3733-f0c9-4561-9ad3-69150c6c8283': ' it was recently

re-trying to improve oneself or quickly giving up on self-improvements-may not only be indicators of traits such as their corresponding facets e.g. achievement striving aspects e.g. industriousness and domains e.g. conscientiousness but may also reflect something unique about how individuals differ from one another. these unique characteristics have been called nuances mccrae 2015 .\\nin other

unstructured-grid three-dimensional hydrodynamic model selfe. the model domain includes chesapeake bay its tributaries and the extended continental shelf in the mid-atlantic bight. the hurricanes chosen for the study are hurricane floyd 1999 and hurricane isabel 2003 both of which made landfall within 100 km of the mouth of the bay. the model results agree reasonably well with field observations of water level velocity and salinity. from the bay's water level response to the hurricanes it was found that the storm surge in the bay has two distinct stages: an initial stage set up by the remote winds and the second stage -a primary surge induced by the local winds. for the initial stage the rising of the coastal sea level was setup by the remote wind of both hurricanes similarly but for the second stage the responses to the two hurricanes' local winds are significantly different. hurricane floyd was followed by down-bay winds that canceled the initial setup and caused a set-down from the upper bay. hurricane isabel on the other hand was followed by up-bay winds which reinforced the initial setup and continued to rise up against the head of the bay. from the perspective of volume and salt fluxes it is evident that an oceanic saltwater influx is pushed into the bay from the continental shelf by the remote wind fields in the initial stages of the storm surge for both floyd and isabel. in the second stage after the hurricane made landfall the bay's local wind plays a key role in modulating the salinity and velocity fields through vertical mixing and longitudinal salt transport. controlled numerical experiments are conducted in order to identify and differentiate the roles played by the local wind in stratified and destratified conditions. down-estuary local wind stress of hurricane floyd-type tends to enhance stratification under moderate winds but exhibits an increasing-then-decreasing stage when the wind stress increases. the up-estuary local wind stress of hurricane isabel-type tends to penetrate deeper into the water column which reduces stratification by reversing gravitational circulation. to characterize mixing conditions in the estuary a modified horizontal richardson number that incorporates wind stress wind direction horizontal salinity gradient and vertical eddy viscosity is used for both hurricanes. finally the direct precipitation of rainfall into the bay during hurricane floyd appears to create not only a thin surface layer of low salinity but also a seaward barotropic pressure gradient that affects the subsequent redistribution of salinity after the storm.\", '9f7143a2-baf2-4ecc-85bf-1dcff60b2f0d': 'abstract abstract. this research describes the creation of a quantitative

of the two-parent families surveyed said they would prefer both father and mother to work part-time but in reality almost none of the families did so clarkberg & moen 2001 . the gendered nature of part-time work has implications for the ways we view employment in families and its relation to child development and family functioning. although a full discussion of these issues would require a longer article we identify gendered issues and assumptions as they relate to the literature reviewed. from the outset it is important to note that mothers' more frequent use of part-time employment

the effects of fathers' part-time employment on child parent and family outcomes.\\nat this point in historical time we believe that mothers' part-time work deserves in-depth attention as a unique employment status because both parents and employers find the classification meaningful and distinct duffy & pupo 1992 pew research center 2007. the literature on maternal part-time employment clearly indicates that mothers view part-time employment as qualitatively different from full-time employment not as a space on a continuous curve of work hours e.g. higgins duxbury & johnson 2000 jacob 2008

using the categories of not employed part-time and full-time e.g. burchinal & clarke-stewart 2007 falzone 2001 jacob 2008 . in addition researchers who have operationalized work hours continuously

repetitive wearing away of enamel tooth loss hearing loss and temporomandibular joint disorder. while this relatively common sleep disorder is thought to have a complex etiology many have noted psychological antecedents. in particular bruxism seems to be more severe during periods of heightened stress and anxiety. the extent to which bruxism is associated with stable individual differences in the tendency to experience negative emotions however have yet to be investigated.\\nthe grinding of teeth has long been held as one physical manifestation of stress and anxiety. for example individuals who grind their teeth tend to report more symptoms of anxiety and depression than non-bruxers gungormus & erciyas 2009 manfredini landi romagnoli & bosco 2004 . and compared to non-bruxers those who grind their teeth tend to report greater life stress and are more likely to suffer from dsm-defined depression and anxiety disorders ohayon li & guilleminault 2001 . even in rats experimentally inducing emotional stress leads to brux-like symptoms compared to controls rosales et al. 2002 .\\nthe association between bruxism and acute symptoms of anxiety and depression as well as its relation to mood disorders raises the possibility that in non-clinical populations teeth grinding may also be associated with stable individual differences in the tendency to experience negative emotions i.e. neuroticism-related personality traits. although most research has focused on acute anxiety and depression there is some evidence that trait somatic anxiety and muscular tension

specifically participants were asked \"does your jaw ever make a clicking sound?\" jaw clicks \"do you have any difficulties chewing food?\" difficulty chewing \"do you feel that your mouth is frequently dry?\" dry mouth \"do you feel that your gums are healthy?\" reversed scored unhealthy gums \"do your gums bleed on brushing?\" gums bleed and \"as an adult do you ever get canker sores in your mouth?\" canker sores. items were scored as the presence 1 or absence 0 of these complaints. correlations among these subjective measures ranged from −.08 ns for dry mouth and gums bleed to .20 p < .05 for unhealthy gums and gums bleed.\\nparticipants also underwent a comprehensive oral examination by a professional dentist baum 1981 . in the present research we focus primarily on the presence and severity of occlusal wear and evidence of tongue indentations. occlusal wear refers to the wearing down of enamel which can result from excessive pressure from the clenching or grinding of teeth. tongue indentations are evidence of biting that can also result from teeth grinding. the dentist noted whether any occlusal wear present was slight moderate or severe and the presence or absence of tongue indentations. we also examined a number of other dentist assessments of oral health: the gingival index which is an assessment of the severity of gingivitis gum inflammation the dmft index which is the number of decayed missing or filled teeth in the mouth the number of teeth with moderate to severe erosion and the number of filled cavities. correlations among these dentist assessments ranged from −.33 p < .05 for tongue indentations and the dmft index to .27 p < .05 for coronal restorations and the dmft index.\\nthe gzts guilford zimmerman & guilford 1976  is a factor-based personality questionnaire consisting of 300 items 30 for each of the 10 gzts scales. for each item participants chose between \"yes\" \"no\" and \"?.\" any scale with more than three \"?\" responses was considered missing a procedure suggested by guilford and colleagues. therefore small variations in the number of participants will be seen in the analyses for different scales. raw scores ranged from 0 to 30.\\nthe gzts scales are valid and reliable guilford et al. 1976 . internal consistency coefficients range from 0.75 to 0.87 median = 0.80. in the blsa the structural stability of the gzts has been shown across age cohort and time-of-measurement mccrae costa & arenberg 1980 . retest stability coefficients for men ranged from 0.64 to 0.78 median = 0.68 over an average interval of 16 years and retest coefficients for women ranged from 0.68 to 0.78 over an average interval of 11 years median = 0.71 terracciano mccrae & costa in press.\\npersonality gzts was collected during regularly scheduled visits for men starting in october 1958 and for women in january 1978 and continuing until may 2002. in the present research because the personality assessment was generally not completed at the same time as the dental examination we ran all of our analyses twice -once with the participant\\'s first assessment of personality and again with each individual\\'s average score across all available personality assessments between 1958 and 2002.\\nresults\\nconsistent with the estimated 20% prevalence in the general population lavigne et al. 2008  approximately 22% of the current sample reported that they grind their teeth at night whereas 67% of participants reported that they did not. the remaining 11% either were not sure bruxed occasionally or did not have teeth these participants were not included in the analyses. controlling for sex age at the dental exam and education participants who scored higher on either emotional stability or objectivity were less likely to report that they grind their teeth see table 1 . the findings were similar for the mean across all assessments of emotional stability and objectivity see table 1 . thus participants who scored higher on neuroticism-related traits were more likely to report that they are bruxers.\\nwe next turn to evidence of physical damage caused by bruxism: occlusal wear and tongue indentations. approximately 66% of the sample had moderate or severe occlusal wear and approximately 50% of the sample had tongue indentations. in contrast to the self-reported bruxism neither emotional stability nor objectivity was associated with either occlusal wear or tongue indentations see table 1 .\\nfor the sake of comparison we report the significant associations between bruxism and the other eight scales of the gzts. the first assessment of sociability but not the mean of \\nnih-pa author manuscript nih-pa author manuscript assessments was associated with less self-reported teeth grinding or = .989596979899 ns. sociability was also associated with less occlusal wear or = .96 95% ci = .94-.99 and or = .95 95% ci = .91-.99 respectively for first and mean assessment. in addition both the first assessment and the mean across assessments of friendliness were also associated with self-reported teeth grinding or = .97 95% ci = .95-. 99 and or = .94 95% ci = .90-.99 respectively. tongue indentations were not associated with any of the gzts traits.\\nfinally we examined the association between the neuroticism-related traits and other subjective and objective markers of oral health. in the present study 20% of participants reported jaw clicks 13% reported difficulty chewing food 20% reported dry mouth 23% reported unhealthy gums 22% reported that their gums bleed and 50% reported canker sores. both emotional stability and objectivity were associated with anxiety-related oral health complaints: participants who scored low on these traits were more likely to report that their jaw makes a clicking sound that they had difficulty chewing food and that they often had a dry mouth see table 2 . both emotional stability and objectivity however were unrelated to the more general oral somatic complaints we assessed: unhealthy gums bleeding gums and canker sores. finally neither emotional stability nor objectivity was associated with dentistassessed gingivitis median r = .00 ns the dmft index median r = .01 ns or the number of teeth with moderate to severe erosion median r = −.02 ns. the first assessment of objectivity correlated positively with the number of filled cavities r = .11 p < .05 this association did not replicate across the mean of objectivity assessments or with emotional stability median r = .05 ns.\\nin this study we examined whether two traits related to neuroticism emotional stability and objectivity were associated with self-reported and physical evidence of teeth grinding. both traits were associated with bruxism: individuals who scored high on either emotional stability or objectivity were less likely to report that they grind their teeth. these two traits were also associated with other anxiety-related oral symptoms but were unrelated to more global selfreported oral complaints. neither trait however was related to the physical damage to teeth or the tongue often attributed to bruxism nor were they related to dentist-assessed health of the teeth and gums.\\nalthough psychological factors are routinely implicated in teeth grinding previous research has focused primarily on state anxiety depression and life stress rather than on stable individual differences in the tendency to experience negative emotions. limited evidence from small samples suggests that the association between trait anxiety and bruxism starts in childhood restrepo vásquez alvarez & valencia 2008 and persists into adulthood kampe et al. 1997 . much of this research however has relied on pathological bruxism rather than the more common teeth grinding found in the general population. the present research supports the association between neuroticism-related traits and bruxism in a community-dwelling sample.\\nindividuals high on neuroticism-related traits consistently report more somatic complaints than individuals low on neuroticism. the association however between neuroticism and physical illness is much weaker than its association with somatic', 'a64dddda-a271-451d-9669-5b1ebdc43249': 'introduction with the exception of a few spells e.g. family leave unemployment and extended vacations a large portion of the adult life course is

the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium. in particular we show that the equilibrium strategies satisfy a network decaying dependence ndd condition requiring that dependence between any two

blood pressure were observed. no data are available however regarding the effects of aging on peripheral arterial stiffness in healthy females. this is noteworthy in that the elastic properties of arteries are not necessarily uniform 3 and aging has been reported to have different effects on the stiffness of peripheral eg brachial and radial and central arteries in men. 6 regular physical activity is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. 7 8 in the blsa mentioned above older adult males who performed endurance exercise on a regular basis demonstrated lower levels of

reforms increased mandated testing and school accountability. the law requires states to almost immediately start administering mathematics and reading examinations based on established state curriculum standards to all students in grades 3-12. in addition to overall progress toward meeting state standards the law also calls for monitoring the progress within each school of students who are economically disadvantaged from racial or ethnic minority groups have disabilities or have limited english proficiency. schools that fail to make state-defined adequate progress toward meeting the state standards will be subjected to increasingly severe sanctions over five years culminating with restructuring such as state takeover or conversion to a charter school. the goal of this legislation is to not only raise academic standards and thus performance for american school children but also to decrease gaps in achievement between socially advantaged and disadvantaged groups.\\nthe provisions in no child left behind were a continuation of efforts over the past 40 years by educational policymakers and practitioners to raise standards in mathematics and science. these reforms have included not only raising expectations for students' mastery of these subjects but also requiring that all students have exposure to a core curriculum incorporating these standards. approximately 20 years ago state policy makers also began implementing examination systems to hold schools accountable for students' academic progress mcdonnell 1994 . both reform efforts-raising expectations and increasing external accountability-redefine what a high school graduate should know and provide incentives for all students to acquire a minimum level of achievement in order to earn a diploma.\\nin response to these reforms schools have raised graduation requirements and restructured their academic programs. between 1980 and 1993 the average number of credits in core academic subjects that schools required for earning a high school diploma increased by over 1.6 years stevenson & schiller 1999 . over two thirds of this change was in requirements for additional courses in mathematics and science. another dramatic change was the softening if not official elimination of formal academic tracking systems in favor of a standards-based core curriculum in which tracks are more subject specific and based on timing of course enrollments lucas 1999 . during the 1980s public high schools increased the size of their academic tracks by 14% to enroll an average of 46% of their sophomore cohorts while vocational track enrollments dropped by 12% to an average of less than 19% of their sophomore cohorts stevenson & schiller 1999 . this shifting of students into the academic track was most dramatic in states requiring test score results to be widely disseminated to policy makers the media and parents.\\ncomplexity of the educational process however means that these efforts to improve students' educational experiences and academic achievement have had mixed results. high-stakes examinations for students for example have been 300 related to higher rates of dropping out for at-risk students but do not appear to affect levels of achievement jacob 2001 . greater school accountability appears to increase the number of advanced mathematics credits high school students eam but does not affect their probability of earning a diploma . in addition these state accountability policies also seem to exacerbate the attainment gap between students of low-and high-socioeconomic backgrounds suggesting that poor students may be negatively impacted by holding schools responsible for their academic progress . thus neither high-stakes examinations for students nor school accountability are a panacea for helping all students reach higher academic standards.\\ndeveloping effective policies requires understanding how proposed reforms may influence student achievement at different stages of the educational process with thoughtful consideration of potential negative effects. this study explores whether students' mathematics course enrollments as freshmen and in high

the current understanding of black-white and latino-white differences in these beliefs by examining whether they are affected by schools' racial and ethnic mix of students and teachers. as i discuss later there are reasons to believe that minority-segregated schools may both positively and negatively influence students' beliefs.\\nin addition to addressing these theoretical issues studying the effects of schools' racial and ethnic composition on students' beliefs has important policy implications because of the current extent of segregation. fifty years have sociology of education 2004 vol.

and accounts for 80 percent of all school segregation reardon 2000 . despite the prevalence and persistence of segregation in american schools few studies have compared students' beliefs across schools with different racial-ethnic compositions. i begin by reviewing the literature on racialethnic differences in beliefs. this literature has generally concluded that the beliefs of blacks and latinos are higher i.e. more optimistic and more pro-school than are those of whites at least as measured in surveys but there is disagreement about why they are higher and whether they improve blacks' and latinos' achievement. after discussing this literature i explain how schools' student and teacher racial compositions may influence beliefs. these two discussions are followed by an analysis of nationally representative data from the national education longitudinal study nels on students' beliefs and schools' racialethnic composition. the results suggest that latinos' and blacks' beliefs are more optimistic and more pro-school in segregated-minority schools especially when these schools also employ many minority teachers. i then examine the influence of these relatively high beliefs on the achievement gaps between these two groups and whites across different school contexts. this analysis reveals that blacks' and latinos' relatively high beliefs consistently shrink the

time. such scenarios may occur in liquid propellant rockets aircraft propellant tanks ships petroleum tankers and other applications. sloshing of a liquid can cause the tank system to deviate due to the buildup of kinetic energy of the liquid and its consequent interaction to the walls of the container. 1 fluid sloshing is defined as the periodic motion of fluid with the free surface in a liquid container. the hydrodynamic forces exerted due to sloshing pose a risk to the structural integrity of the tank walls. 2 this concern is augmented with the constantly increasing size of space vehicles and rocket vehicle propellant containers and the significant dynamic forces they are exposed to. 3 for this reason propellant management devices pmd are not a new domain of the engineering world. through the years various techniques to dampen the motion of the liquid propellant have come into existence and such techniques involve passive structural devices and active mechanisms 4 . a diaphragm is a type of passive pmd that is implemented within the propellant tank itself. as the liquid propellant leaves the tank the diaphragm compresses and lessens the amount of surface area in which the liquid would originally slosh. a baffle is a similar type of passive pmd that creates a simple barrier that acts to restrict the physical motion of the liquid thus damping the amount of slosh it can exhibit. the two main types of baffles are wall-fixed and floating each accompanied by their own set of advantages and disadvantages. 3 the primary advantage of floating baffles is the reduced weight over their wall-fixed counterparts. additionally wall-fixed baffles are limited in their placement with respect to the tank walls due to the presence of supporting structures which may be located on the tank walls. 4 active damping mechanisms physically create waves that destructively interfere with the liquid propellant undergoing sloshing. by changing the frequency at which these waves are created the magnitude of the sloshing waves can be controlled. should the operating frequency of the mechanism coincide with the resonant frequency of the propellant the sloshing waves of the propellant would be completely dampened instantaneously. unlike the passive pmds this mechanism has never been implemented into an operating space system. some of the designs include mounting baffles of various shapes to the inner sidewall of the tank. 5 previous research of slosh suppression via floating baffles has indicated that successful damping of fluid slosh is based on the same principle baffle members interact by colliding with one another thus absorbing the kinetic energy imparted to the fuel upon movement of the tank. 6 other baffle methods are defined as successful by increasing the natural frequency of the tank sections and decreasing the wave amplitude at the free surface. 3 a study on the analysis of boundary element models for liquid sloshing concludes that the effect of the baffle position on the slosh reduction is more important than the geometry and location of the baffle especially if the baffles are appropriately located near the free surface. 2 the concept of floating electro-active micro-baffles is adapted from previous research involving the constrained floating baffle and also the use of a diaphragm on the free surface. 5 it provides a structural layer to constrain the free surface of the liquid. floating micro-baffles allow the damping of slosh at all filled levels of the tank and also adapt to the attitude of the vehicle. upon exposure to magnetic fields of varying strength it is predicted that the rigidity of the structural layer can adapt to various slosh conditions. furthermore this slosh suppression method preserves the natural frequency increase and kinetic energy interactions that correspond to both wall-fixed and floating baffle pmds. the challenges encountered and the milestones achieved at this stage of the development of floating electro-active micro-baffles specifically in the development of the micro-baffle design the magnetic activation source and proof-of-concept experiments are documented.',

control. glandular stimulation was achieved using 2% citric acid at 30-second intervals to the dorsal surface of the tongue. salivary flow rates sfr were calculated by total weight of saliva divided by 5 minutes and expressed in ml/minute. coronal caries were scored using the nidr dmfs index. carious lesions were classified according to tooth surfaces by a calibrated single examiner. spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the association between sfr with age and percentage of carious teeth. multiple regression analyses were calculated at p < 0.05. results: the variables gender race age health status medication usage and salivary function were not predictors for dental disease. additionally these risk factors were not risk factors for missing teeth. conclusions: in conclusion cross-sectional investigations are limited in their ability to identify the relevant variables for disease prediction. in addition clinical and basic science investigations will be necessary to assess risk factors for dental caries.', 'bbebe836-66f7-4c7a-ad60-64e87e8b5ee8': 'abstract this study investigates whether a machine-learning-based system can predict the rate of

school environment which depends in part on the abilities attitudes and performance of their classmates. similarly the neighborhood environment may affect school outcomes via positive or negative role models and local attitudes about the value of schooling relative to other pursuits. these two factors tend to reinforce one another because schools are often directly or indirectly neighborhood institutions.\\nmany previous studies have addressed school context effects and neighborhood effects on achievement. researchers with good school data usually study school context effects whereas researchers with good neighborhood-level data tend to study neighborhood effects. given the high degree of correlation between school and neighborhood characteristics any analysis that omits one of

understanding dynamic and populated areas that are impacted by storm surge and flooding. to understand these natural hazard risks lidar elevation surfaces are frequently used to model inundation in coastal areas. a single-value surface method is sometimes used to inundate areas in lidar elevation surfaces that are below a specified elevation value. however such an approach does not take into consideration hydrologic connectivity between elevation grids cells resulting in inland areas that should be hydrologically connected to the ocean but are not. because inland areas that should drain to the ocean are hydrologically disconnected by raised features in a lidar elevation surface simply raising the water level to propagate coastal inundation will lead to inundation uncertainties. we took advantage of this problem to identify hydrologically disconnected inland areas to point out that they should be considered for coastal inundation and that a lidar-based hydrologic surface should be developed with hydrologic connectivity prior to inundation analysis. the process of achieving hydrologic connectivity with hydrologic-enforcement is not new however the application of

adopted or amended to protect and conserve wetland resources national wetlands policy forum 1988 . the intent of the nwpf was to shift united states wetland regulation toward a policy of \"no net

those triggering mitigation by current u.s. laws are likely to be necessary if wetland gains are to outpace wetlands losses.\\nto determine how much restoration may be necessary to outpace current and future wetland losses we first assessed how coastal wetlands have changed in the united states in the most recently reported 15 years period spanning 1996-2010 shortly after the implementation of nnl. we then synthesized data on federally funded wetland restoration efforts that were not mandated by current u.s. compliance or mitigation requirements termed \"voluntary\" herein to determine if current efforts have the potential to outpace coastal wetland losses now and in the future. we then attempted to identify local and regional hotspots of wetland change and compare those loss/gain hotspots with restoration efforts in those areas. further because voluntary restoration projects were not driven by mitigation requirements that often mandate restoration to be in close spatial proximity to impacted wetlands we investigated the degree to which siting of voluntary restoration may be creating local and regional \"winners\" and \"losers.\" finally we make recommendations for determining how much and where future wetland restoration should occur and what additional data should be collected to inform these decisions.', 'c3e3c6b4-cb3d-41c5-9b89-cfc7b37a68f2': 'abstract

cfpwv measurement protocols and inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the online-only data supplement methods and table 1 .\\nonly cohorts that measured cfpwv based on the carotid-to-femoral transit time and distance were included in the meta-analysis. cfpwv increases nonlinearly and exhibits marked variance inflation with advancing age resulting in a strongly right skewed distribution. in addition differences in the method used to ascertain transit distance can alter values by up to 30% and the amount of error may be influenced by sex and other anthropomorphic factors such as height and weight. thus genetic association analyses were performed using a sex-specific standardized residual that was based on the inverse of cfpwv which normalizes the distribution and that was further adjusted for age age squared height and weight. as a result of these transformations the cohorts had a highly comparable distribution of the phenotype mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 with a normal distribution.\\ngenotyping and imputation methods have been described previously and are summarized in online-only data supplement table s1 . for genome-wide snp sets

cohort-specific and sex-specific standardized regression residual for 1000/cfpwv adjusted for age age squared height and weight. genome-wide association analyses were conducted within each cohort using an additive gene-dose model. linear mixed effects models were fitted to account for relatedness in pedigrees. withinstudy associations were combined by prospective meta-analysis using inverse-variance weighting. meta-analyses were performed using the software program metabel http://www.genabel.org/ packages/metabel. during meta-analysis snps were excluded if weighted mean minor allele frequency was ͻ1% resulting in 2.41 million snps for analysis. the genomic control parameter was calculated to adjust each study and after meta-analysis was recalculated to adjust for among-study heterogeneity. for the initial meta-analysis a predetermined threshold of 4.0ϫ10 ϫ7 stage 1 was used to select snps for attempted replication. 7 based on a preliminary analysis of 6 cohorts we selected snps from 2 loci the snp with the lowest p and 1 or 2 proxy snps to accommodate differing genotyping platforms for attempted replication. snps were genotyped in 2 additional cohorts and analyzed within cohort using a similar analysis plan except that observed rather than imputed genotypes were used in the analyses. results from the 2 replication cohorts were then combined by meta-analysis. we considered a pͻ0.025 0.05/2 and same direction of effect for the replication meta-analysis as indicative of successful replication.\\nto assess possible effect modification by age we performed an age-stratified analysis based on the approximate overall median age of 55 years. for cohorts that spanned this age cutoff fhs erf sardinia acct analyses were repeated in subgroups ͻ55

adequate sample size. these groupings resulted in 9 sets of data consisting of predominantly older participants and 6 sets of data consisting of predominantly younger participants. in addition because of known associations between cfpwv and clinical events [1][2][3][4]8 we performed lookups of the top result from our cfpwv gwas in separate gwas meta-analyses for clinical end points thought to be related to arterial stiffness including coronary artery disease heart failure stroke and kidney disease. we also performed a lookup of our top result in an ongoing pulse pressure gwas meta-analysis in order to determine whether genetic effects on aortic stiffness were detectable as an increase in blood pressure pulsatility in additional cohorts see the online-only data supplement for details of clinical gwas meta-analyses.\\ncharacteristics of participants at the time of cfpwv measurement in the 11 9 discovery 2 replication aortagen consortium cohorts are presented in table 1 . cohort mean age varied from 34 to 75 years whereas cohort mean cfpwv varied from 5.5 to 13.6 m/s corresponding to inverse cfpwv of 193-77 ms/m respectively. sample sizes varied from 618 to 6033 participants with

bcl11b is nearly 1 mb telomeric to this locus. the associated snps are located in a block of ld spanning from approximately 97.60 -97.74 mb which corresponds closely with the location of a cluster of previously documented overlapping spliced expressed sequence tags ests including db129663 and bp432414 which are on the minus and plus strand respectively. one of our highly associated snps rs710285 pϭ5.1ϫ10 ϫ11  is located in exon 3 of db129663. in addition there is a conserved sequence near the center of the chromosome 14 locus 97.67 mb figure  3  in overlapping intronic regions of db129663 and bp432414.\\nto assess potential functional implications of our findings we used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt-pcr to evaluate expression of db129663 and bp432414 in human aortic samples and various cell lines. in light of the putative role of this region as a remote enhancer of bcl11b 9 and relative proximity to vrk1 we also probed for expression of these genes online-only data supplement table s4 . db129663 bp432414 bcl11b and vrk1 were detected in whole aortic rings online-only data supplement table s4 . vrk1 and db129663 were expressed in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells human umbilical vein endothelial cells huvecs and adult cardiac fibroblasts. bcl11b was expressed in the same samples except cardiac fibroblasts. all transcripts were expressed in cd3ϩ cells.\\nto assess the potential clinical relevance of our finding of a locus on chr14 strongly associated with cfpwv we performed a lookup of our top snp for association with cfpwv in the meta-analysis of 9 cohorts rs1381289 table  2  in results from separate clinical end point gwas metaanalyses see online-only data supplement. we found an association with increased risk for coronary artery disease hazard ratio [hr]ϭ1.05 confidence interval [ci]ϭ1.02-1.08 per allele pϭ0.0013 and heart failure hrϭ1.10 ciϭ1.03-1.16 per allele pϭ0.004. to aid interpretation of these cvd end point associations we used data from fhs to estimate the expected hr for a first major cvd event associated with presence of each allele of rs1381289 assuming that excess cvd risk was mediated by effects of the allele on cfpwv. 4 in fhs after adjusting for age and sex cfpwv was associated with an excess cvd risk corresponding to an hrϭ1.65 per sd. based on this estimate and given that each minor allele of rs1381289 was associated with a 0.073 sd increase in cfpwv the expected hrϭ1.047 per allele which is comparable to the gwas lookup results. in a separate meta-analysis that included 74 011 participants rs1381289 was associated with higher pulse pressure ␤ϭ0.18ϯ0.06 mm hg/allele pϭ0.002 indicating that the increase in aortic stiffness associated with this snp is detectable as a modest but significant increase in pressure pulsatility. the snp was not associated with stroke pͼ0.7 glomerular filtration rate estimated by using serum creatinine pͼ0.6 or cystatin pͼ0.5 or prevalent chronic kidney disease pͼ0.6.\\nwe also sought to replicate a previously reported association between cfpwv and a snp rs3742207 in col4a1. 10 after excluding 2 cohorts involved in the original report sardinia hapi we found modest evidence of association for this snp rs3742207 ␤ϭϫ0.025ϯ0.011 sd/allele pϭ0.017 online-only data supplement figure s1 .\\nwe performed a meta-analysis of gwas results for cfpwv from 9 community-based cohorts involving 20 634 participants spanning a broad age range and identified a locus of genome-wide significant association in an apparent gene desert on 14q32.2. this finding was replicated in 2 additional cohorts involving 5306 participants. we identified a conserved sequence within the region of significant association surrounded by a cluster of primatespecific noncoding rnas ncrnas. we evaluated 2 of these ncrnas which have at least 1 associated snp within an exon and demonstrated that they are expressed in relevant human cardiac and vascular tissues and cell lines including full thickness aortic rings aortic smooth muscle cells cardiac fibroblasts and huvecs. in light of the putative role of the region of significant association as a gene enhancer 91112 we also assayed for and demonstrated expression of flanking known genes bcl11b and vrk1 in the same tissues and cell lines. our findings indicate that the vrk1-bcl11b gene desert harbors a regulatory locus that modulates aortic stiffness. the association was consistent in younger and older participants suggesting that the effects on cfpwv of genetic variation at this locus manifest early in life before the marked increase in cfpwv that occurs from midlife onward. in addition we demonstrated that the locus is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease consistent with the hypothesis that increased aortic stiffness as assessed by cfpwv plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. further elucidation of potential mechanisms of aortic stiffening mediated through this locus may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of aortic stiffening and could potentially offer insights into currently unavailable targeted interventions that prevent or attenuate aortic stiffening with advancing age and reduce the associated excess risk for major cvd events. cfpwv has emerged recently as an important risk factor for various afflictions of aging including cvd cognitive dysfunction and chronic kidney disease. cfpwv is easily and reproducibly measured in a few minutes using relatively inexpensive technology and is widely considered the present gold standard noninvasive measure of aortic stiffness. aside from age with which it is strongly related cfpwv has consistent but relatively modest relations with standard cvd risk factors and is moderately heritable rendering the phenotype optimal for genetic studies.\\na number of prior studies have evaluated potential genetic correlates of various measures of arterial stiffness including cfpwv. family-based studies have identified several regions of potential linkage for stiffness measures using a microsatellite-based whole genome approach. 6 genetic association studies have found relations between measures of arterial stiffness and polymorphisms in various candidate genes including genes for the angiotensin ii type 1 receptor 13 fibrillin-1 14 angiotensin-converting enzyme 1516 ␣-adducin 15 aldosterone synthase 1517 ␤-adrenergic receptors 18 endothelin a and b receptors 19 matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 9 2021 endothelial nitric oxide synthase 22 the large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 23 estrogen genes 24 and various inflammatory genes. 25 26 however small sample sizes ascertainment bias hypertensive known coronary artery disease etc and relatively weak associations may have limited the generalizability and consistency of findings. notably none of the aforementioned candidate genes are in the top hits of the present analysis tables 2 and s3 . two prior cfpwv gwas publications 1027 were similarly based on relatively small sample sizes and employed less dense genotyping which limited power to detect associations. a relative paucity of genome-wide significant findings remains a concern with our present publication involving 9 discovery and 2 replication cohorts and an aggregate sample size of nearly 26 000 individuals. additional work and larger samples will be required to determine whether any additional loci in the group of excess low probability values below ϸ1ϫ10 ϫ4 are true positive associations.\\nprior studies provide evidence that the region of association with cfpwv that we have identified on 14q32.2 lies in the vicinity of 1 or more gene enhancers. the region encompasses various regulatory features including several dnase-i hypersensitive sites and transcription factor binding sites and high levels of nuclear matrix attachment. 91112 chromatin modifications in the region including high levels of acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 h3k27 and monomethylation at lysine 4 h3k4 assessed in a lymphoblastoid cell line are consistent with enhancer function http://genome.ucsc. edu. 28 despite considerable genomic separation from the enhancer cluster ϸ1 mb telomeric bcl11b is thought to be a target of one or more of the enhancers in this locus. 91112 bcl11b is located on the minus strand positioning the enhancer cluster in the remote 3ј region of the gene. the closest known gene in the opposite direction vrk1 isϸ1.1 mb centromeric to the enhancer cluster and is on the plus strand again positioning the enhancer in the remote 3ј region of vrk1 suggesting that one or both genes could potentially be targets of a remote 3ј enhancer in this region.\\nin support of bcl11b as a target numerous translocations have been described that insert fragments of 5q35 at various positions in a breakpoint cluster region that falls between the enhancer region and 3ј bcl11b. these translocations interpose the homeobox genes tlx3 or nkx2-5 between the enhancer region and 3ј bcl11b and result in ectopic activation of the inserted homeobox gene dysregulated t-cell proliferation and acute t-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. 91112 t-cell regulatory signals directed at bcl11b may interact with the enhancer to drive ectopic activation of the interposed homeobox gene leading to cell-specific malignant transformation. su et al used translocation data to map enhancer function to a 58-kb segment of the genome that corresponds to the telomeric shoulder of our locus of significant association with cfpwv. 12 relative proximity of the enhancer to bcl11b the important role that bcl11b plays in t-cell development and the t-cell specificity of malignant transformations involving translocations into the region support the hypothesis that bcl11b is a target of this enhancer.\\nbcl11b codes for chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor coup-tf interacting protein 2 ctip2 which is a cofactor in the coup-tf family of transcription factors 29 and a direct transcriptional repressor. 30 there are several potential mechanisms for an effect of bcl11b on aortic stiffness. coup-tfii nr2f2 modulates the angiopoietin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor pathways and plays a critical role in the development of the heart and great vessels. 31 in addition bcl11b is a c 2 h 2 zinc finger protein that can directly bind dna in a sequence specific manner. acting in part through an interaction with sirt1 bcl11b can effect transcriptional repression of various genes that may be relevant to aortic stiffness. [32] [33] [34] [35] in addition to direct effects of bcl11b on aortic function there are potential indirect effects mediated through the known role that bcl11b plays in t-cell function. t-cell-specific deletion of bcl11b at the cd4ϩ single positive stage is associated with increased numbers of proinflammatory t-cells that could potentially infiltrate the aorta and promote inflammation fibrosis and stiffening. 3637 additional work will be required to establish the potential role that genetic variation in the chromosome 14 locus may play in bcl11b expression and aortic function. we demonstrated that 2 overlapping ests that fall completely within the region of highly significant association with cfpwv are expressed in aortic tissue and cell lines. these primate-specific potentially regulatory ncrnas are expressed in cdna extracts from full-thickness human aortic rings and various human cell lines including aortic smooth muscle cells huvecs and cardiac fibroblasts. one of the highly associated snps in the region rs710285 is located in an exon of db129663 suggesting a possible functional effect. the enhancer core region mapped by su et al corresponds to the putative promoter region of db129663. thus enhancer function at our chromosome 14 locus may target db129663 which appears to be an ncrna of unknown function. additional work will be required to test this hypothesis and further define the function of db129663 and other ncrnas in the region.\\nseveral additional snps with suggestive associations to cfpwv 10 ϫ8 ͻpͻ10 ϫ5  may merit further consideration and additional replication genotyping. the locus on chromosome 10 with the second lowest probability value in our gwas meta-analysis lies in the vicinity of a putative protein coding gene that may represent a novel member of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein lrp family. 38 we found moderate evidence for association at the lrp4 locus which is also associated with stroke 39 and bone mineral density. 40 41 the lrp4 locus includes a nonsynonymous snp rs6485702 that has been related to bone mineral density 40 although a separate report involving several of our cohorts positioned the region of highest association with bone mineral density in the promoter region of arhgap1. 41 bone density and arterial stiffness are related phenotypes 42 that may share many common pathways. the recently observed inhibitory role that lrp4 plays in wnt signaling in bone 43 coupled with the adverse effects of wnt signaling in the aorta 44 suggests that a mutation that impairs the ability of lrp4 to modulate the wnt signaling cascade could simultaneously contribute to osteopenia and aortic stiffening. the chromosome 11 locus that encompasses lrp4 and additional potential candidates including arhgap1 and f2 represents a long ld block that was also associated with stroke in a prior meta-analysis that included several of the cohorts in our study. 39 the direction of effect in the prior study higher risk for the minor allele and ours stiffer aorta with the minor allele was consistent with the known association between increased cfpwv and increased risk for stroke. in addition a prior family-based linkage analysis for myocardial infarction found a single significant linkage peak in the vicinity of our chromosome 14 locus. 45 these regions of overlap with prior results involving separate but related phenotypes support the clinical relevance of our associations and suggest that several genetic variants that impact cfpwv may eventually manifest as age-related morbidity and major cardiovascular events.\\nwe also attempted to replicate a previously reported association of cfpwv with a snp in the col4a1 locus in the only published gwas that has evaluated cfpwv. 10 the present results found modest evidence of association with some heterogeneity of effect suggesting that additional work will be required to determine whether variation in ld patterns or other factors could potentially account for heterogeneous effects at this locus.\\nthere are limitations of our study that should be considered. the cohorts comprised exclusively white participants of european descent. thus our findings may not generalize to other populations. slightly different methods were used to assess cfpwv in the various cohorts. however our use of standardized residuals generated within each cohort should have minimized the effects of these technical differences between studies. a major strength of our study is the use of data from 11 large community-based cohorts that routinely ascertained cf-pwv which should enhance generalizability of our findings.\\nin conclusion we performed the first large-scale gwas of cfpwv which is a moderately heritable measure of aortic stiffness and important risk factor for cardiovascular events. we identified a highly significant locus of association at 14q32.2 in the vrk1-bcl11b gene desert in an ld block that harbors 1 or more gene enhancers. we have also shown that genetic variation at this locus is associated with increased risk for major cvd events providing strong support for the hypothesis that increased cfpwv contributes to the pathogenesis of cvd. we have shown that 2 potentially regulatory ncrnas as well as flanking genes bcl11b and vrk1 are expressed in human aorta. further work will be required to define precise mechanisms mediating the association between cfpwv and genetic variation in the vrk1-bcl11b gene desert. elucidation of pathways affected by this locus will provide new insights into the process of aortic stiffening in humans and could yield potential targets for specific interventions that reverse or attenuate aortic stiffening and prevent the associated morbidity and mortality.', 'c518fe05-128b-4adc-9d5e-1a96f75e223b': 'abstract although neural networks do offer a few advantages over some other nonlinear methods in certain situations these advantages

rates in 10 patients with essential hypertension when compared with age and gender matched normotensive controls. conversely in a racially mixed population nieder- meier et al.\" found no differences in unstimulated and stimulated whole salivary flow rates in persons with hypertension when compared with a control group with normal blood pressure. both studies used whole saliva in their investigations. however no information is available on the influence of elevated blood pressure on major salivary gland flow rates.\\nthe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of

occurring during flight tests of fighter aircraft are well documented. in many cases the cause of the problem could be characterised as inadequate modelling or other inappropriate treatment of the aeroelastic effects on the vehicle dynamics and/or the flight-control design. however such problems are not restricted to just aircraft. especially long and slender bodies such as small conventional launch systems may suffer from an unwanted coupling between the rigid body and its flexible modes. in addition due to fuel consumption during the flight the change in atmospheric environment and aerodynamic effects the entire flight profile should be examined rather than a single worst-case point to identify the stability and controllability performance of the launch vehicle. the current research treats the launch vehicle as a flexible beam with lumped masses to account for the subsystems and fuel using a three-dimensional assumedmodes method with longitudinal and lateral effects. sloshing is added to the system as a spring-mass-damper where the liquid oxidiser and fuel are modelled separately. multiple discrete flight points are considered for aeroelastic analysis at different stages of the ascent profile. these individual points are analysed as quasi-static and quasi-steady inputs for a continuous flight trajectory simulation. the stability and controllability for the entire flight under the influence of wind gust and turbulence is estimated based on this simulation. while simulating the manoeuvres with the sloshing model included it became apparent that the very simple pd controller was not able to stabilise the vehicle. results concerning the influence of sloshing can therefore not be shown. the development of a more robust adaptive controller is currently on its way and it is expected that this non-linear controller will be better suited to handle the strong non-linearities of the combination of flexibility sloshing and a demanding wind environment. *

education working with children from immigrant families this article first briefly addresses the relationship between home literacy environment and english language learners\\' literacy development in both their heritage language and english. second through surveying the literature i identify three different areas in which a home literacy environment influences english language learners\\' literacy development: a through language attitudes and parental beliefs b through identity formation and c through literacy behaviour of immigrant parents. some helpful strategies learned from the literature are provided for educators to use with newcomer families in support of children\\'s literacy development.\\nliteracy development is essential to a child\\'s school performance and future success. yet literacy is not a single monolithic and autonomous construct street 2000 . here literacy is defined as a social practice that is socially constructed in educational and cultural contexts including skills in dealing with printed and nonprint-based texts and in critical thinking kahn & kellner 2005 . this definition is in contrast to a singular autonomous notion of literacy in which literacy development emphasizes decoding a text and studies involve the analysis of literacy rates comprehension levels ages and reading and writing skills kahn & kellner 2005 . multiple literacies consider literacy to be a social practice street 2000  where context and meaning in groups of different cultural linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds need consideration. just as cultural and linguistic backgrounds in families vary literacy practices vary between and within cultures.\\nin addition rapid development in technology has changed how we look at literacy the idea of multiliteracies shifts our thinking about literacy from privileging the printed text to acknowledging various ways that literacy is practiced in a society cope & kalantzis 2009 . with the increasing use of technology literacy is no longer restricted to an ability to deal with printed texts but has expanded to include electronic and multimedia modes. nonetheless as cope and kalantzis 2009 argue \"whichever way we look written language is not going away. it is just becoming more closely intertwined with the other modes\" p. 182.\\nin this paper an english language learner ell will refer to preschool and early elementary grade children whose first language is not english and who are learning english as a second language in a north american setting shi 2011 . learners of english as a second language may include children from africa bangladesh hispanic regions china laos and many others shi 2012 . although different terms appear in the literature to describe such learners english language learner is increasingly utilized because it highlights the learning process instead of a deficiency in nonnative english-speaking students gere 2008 .\\nbecause literacy is a socially constructed practice children who are learning english and whose parents speak another language and come from a culture different from that of the mainstream culture will inevitably be influenced by literacy practices at home. therefore i have prepared a representative not comprehensive review of published research in the past decade that is focused on preschool to early elementary grade children and addresses the relationship between a home literacy environment hle and ell literacy development. i will:\\n1. define the concepts of hle and home literacy practices and briefly review relevant research regarding the relationship between home literacy practices heritage language maintenance and the acquisition of english as a second language. 2. identify three areas in which a hle influences ell literacy development: a language attitudes and parental beliefs b identity formation and c literacy behaviour of immigrant parents. 3. identify strategies that educators can use to work with newcomer families in support of their children\\'s literacy development.\\na child\\'s literacy development involves home school and community support. in this paper i focus the discussion on the literacy environment at home burgess hecht & lonigan 2002 sénéchal & lefevre 2002 teale 1986 . a hle consists of a variety of attitudes resources and practices in the home that influence children\\'s literacy practices and development burgess hecht & lonigan 2002 . in the literature researchers define the hle in a variety of ways. teale 1986  for example categorize the hle as a physical and social environment defining it as a the physical environment where print exists and b the social environment where children siblings and parents interact with print. however this construct emphasizes the role of print in literacy development. cope and kalantzis 2009 suggest that it is important to consider multiliteracies with \"linguistic visual audio gestural and spatial modes of meaning becoming increasingly integrated in everyday media and cultural practices\" p. 166. alternatively burgess hecht and lonigan 2002 define the hle as either passive or active. in a passive environment parents indirectly model behaviours such as parental leisure reading parental literacy beliefs the number of books at home and public library visits. in an active environment parents engage children in literacy activities such as shared reading activities. similarly sénéchal and lefevre 2002 define home literacy activities as informal or formal. informal experiences focus on information in a storybook such as the meaning of a story while formal literacy experiences centre on print such as talking about the letters or providing the names and sounds of specific letters. however the definitions proposed by burgess hecht and lonigan 2002 and by sénéchal and lefevre 2002 are from studies with english native speakers rather than english language learners. in addition these definitions ignore the concept of multiliteracies.\\nof these different definitions i have adopted that of teale 1986  however i extend the idea of a physical literacy environment to include multiliteracy elements such as the multimodal texts in pokemon and yugio characters presented in television film and game cards pahl 2003 . here i focus on linguistic visual and audio elements of literacy behaviour without considering gestural and spatial modes of meaning in literacy activities. i maintain that a hle consists of a number of activities that children observe at home and activities in which parents participate actively. a hle also includes parental beliefs regarding literacy the parental education level the family socioeconomic status the number of books at home and daily life activities in the social domains auerbach 1989 teale 1986 van steensel 2006 .\\nwith the understanding that literacy practices are socially constructed children\\'s literacy experiences in daily life will inevitably influence their literacy development. many different terms are used interchangeably in the literature street 2000 to refer to literacy experiences such as literacy events literacy activities literacy patterns literacy strategies and literacy situations. i use the term literacy practices to denote children\\'s multiple literacy experiences in home settings. the idea of literacy practice refers to a broad \"cultural conception of particular ways of thinking about and doing reading and writing in cultural contexts\" street 2000 p. 22 and offers the potential to understand observable behaviour within different cultural contexts. that is the concept of a literacy practice is broader than that of literacy events as the latter is used primarily in a descriptive way without offering any possibility of understanding how meaning in literacy is constructed street 2000 .\\nto attain an understanding of how a hle influences ell literacy development current research has taken two approaches. one line of research examines the effect of the hle on heritage language maintenance. a heritage language is a language other than english that is associated with an individual\\'s ethnic or cultural background chinen & tucker 2005 . in terms of order of acquisition this is the first language for an individual however an individual may not completely acquire this language because of a transfer to the dominant language such as english in a host country valdés 2000 . the role of heritage language maintenance in promoting second language development is well documented in the literature heritage language maintenance is directly associated with english proficiency and academic achievement suarez 2007 yeung marsh & suliman 2000 . bilingualism is not a disadvantage for children who are acquiring literacy in a second language dickinson mccabe clark-chiarelli & wolf 2004 . cummins 1981 cummins   1983 proposes a common underlying proficiency model to explain this effect where literacy-related skills are transferable across languages. cummins 1981 argues that given adequate exposure to a second language concepts developed in the first language can be transferred. however it may be noted that ells have diverse backgrounds in terms of heritage language proficiency. some learners might develop their first language literacy in formal educational settings while others start and develop the language at home.\\nresearchers have identified a number of practices of a hle that positively influence heritage language maintenance farruggio 2010 lao 2004 wu 2005 . these practices may include but are not limited to sending a child to a heritage language school speaking a heritage language at home liao & larke 2008  emphasizing the value of learning the language chinen & tucker 2005 lynch 2003 a second line of research uses a variety of methods and designs e.g. ethnography and case study to examine how home literacy practices influence ell literacy development in second language acquisition garcia 2008 li 2006a 2006b menard-warwick 2005 perry kay & brown 2008 reese & gallimore 2000 zhang 2007 . given the complex and heterogeneous population of ells qualitative researchers in the last decade have employed interviews observations focus groups and documents in the study of the hle shi 2012 . these studies include analyses of how the hle affects the literacy behaviour of chinese children liu & vadeboncoeur 2010  how immigrant parental beliefs affect literacy acquisition garcia 2008  and how chinese immigrant family human and social capital affect literacy li 2006a . these studies examine the hle of learners from many different ethnic backgrounds and demonstrate that a hle shapes the development of english language literacy shi 2012 .\\nin summary current research helps us to understand the scope and complexity of the hle of immigrant families from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. however there is a lack of consideration in the literature of how hle influences ell children\\'s literacy development in specific areas. it is important to connect both heritage language maintenance and learning english as a second language to ell literacy development because these two areas may embody distinct hles in literacy development. therefore a review of the literature in both areas is of paramount importance.',

of the literature predict a plateau at age 30 or at age 50 or a curvilinear peak in consistency at age 50. these predictions were evaluated at group and individual levels using longitudinal data from the guilford-zimmerman temperament survey and the revised neo personality inventory over periods of up to 42 years. consistency declined toward a non-zero asymptote with increasing time-interval. although some scales showed increasing stability after age 30 the rank-order consistencies of the major dimensions and most facets of the five-factor model were unrelated to age. ipsative stability assessed with the california adult q-set was also unrelated to age. these data strengthen claims of predominant personality stability after age 30.\\nfive-factor model personality development long-term stability individual differences life-span older adults since data from longitudinal studies appeared in the 1970s e.g. block 1977  it has been clear that individual differences in personality traits are stable over long periods of time. helson and wink 1992 reported typical results in a sample of 101 women initially aged 43 and retested after 9 years: the median retest correlation for scales from the california psychological inventory cpi gough 1987 was .73. there is also considerable evidence that personality traits are more stable in adults than in adolescents. for example finn 1986 showed that the median 30-year retest correlation for factors from the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory mmpi hathaway & mckinley 1943 was .35 for respondents initially aged 17 to 25 and .56 for respondents initially aged 43-53.\\nhowever there is disagreement about the degree of rank-order consistency in different portions of adulthood. based on their own research and review of the literature mccrae and costa 1990 argued that \"personality change is the exception rather than the rule after age 30 somewhere in the decade between 20 and 30 individuals attain a configuration of traits that will characterize them for years to come\" p. 10. ten years later two meta-analyses were published on the rank-order consistency or differential stability of personality traits. roberts and delvecchio 2000 reported that rank-order consistency increased with age even in adulthood. they estimated that 30-and 40-year-olds would show 7-year retest correlations near .60 whereas individuals over age 50 would show retest correlations over . 70 and they concluded that recent generations have \"stretched the time it takes to fully develop one\\'s traits\" p. 18 past age 30. curiously another meta-analysis published the correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to antonio terracciano box #03 gerontology research center 5600 nathan shock drive

rank-order consistency increased up to age 50 but decreased thereafter.\\nmeta-analyses combine data from different instruments samples and historical times and may be subject to confounds e.g. studies of 30-year-olds may have used less reliable instruments than studies of 60-year-olds. an alternative approach would examine rankorder stability in different age groups using the same instrument administered to comparable samples over the same time interval and in the same historical period. such a design was used by  who examined 6-and 12-year retest coefficients for guilford-zimmerman temperament survey gzts guilford zimmerman & guilford 1976 costa and mccrae 1988 in a six-year study of men and women assessed with the neo personality inventory costa & mccrae 1985  and by mccrae 2001  who analyzed 6-year retest data in spouse ratings and 7-year retest data in peer ratings of personality. all of these studies suggest that personality is quite stable among young and old adults as well as those in midlife.\\nthe present article updates these studies of blsa participants using longer retest intervals on the gzts and new data from the revised neo personality inventory neo-pi-r costa & mccrae 1992b. in addition longitudinal self-sorts on the california adult q-sort caq bem & funder 1978 block 1961 are examined to determine the effect of initial age on the ipsative stability of personality.\\nthe blsa has both strengths and limitations as a sample in which to test these hypotheses.\\nit is a large sample that has followed some participants for more than 40 years and the welleducated and cooperative respondents provide data of high quality. however they are clearly not representative of the population as a whole. in particular the sample is biased toward older age making it less than optimal for examining stability in the earliest decade of adulthood. there is however general agreement that personality is less stable before 30 than after the present study therefore examines several forms of stability after age 30 where competing predictions have been made. group-level analyses test-retest correlations facilitate comparisons with previous studies and can address the hypothesis that the degree of stability is related to age. however we also examine stability at the individual level computing a measure of stability for each individual that can be used in multilevel analysis to define in greater detail the effect of age on stability while controlling for other variables.\\nfraley and roberts 2005 have recently emphasized the importance of a second issue in studying stability or change in rank-order consistency across the lifespan: the shape of the function relating consistency to retest interval. retest correlations are typically lower over longer retest intervals-for example the median retest correlation for gzts scales after 6 years was .77 after 24 years it was .65 costa & mccrae 1992c-and researchers have typically assumed an exponential decay of consistency e.g. conley 1984 . using that model costa and mccrae 1992c projected that the median stability of gzts true scores after 50 years would be .60 and concluded that \"about three-fifths of the variance in personality traits is stable across the full adult age range\" p. 182.\\nfraley and roberts 2005 pointed out that the exponential decay model predicts that eventually rank-order consistency will decline to zero unless there are developmental constancy factors such as one\\'s unchanging genetic endowment that force consistency to a non-zero asymptote. such a model is testable only with data from multiple administrations \\nmost previous analyses of differential stability have examined retest correlations within different age groups. roberts and delvecchio 2000 suggested that these correlations are higher among adults over age 50 than among younger adults including those in their 30s and 40s. ardelt 2000 reported a curvilinear relation to age with stability coefficients peaking around age 50. to test those hypotheses we divided the blsa sample by initial age into groups aged 30-50 50-65 and 65+. mccrae and costa 1990 would expect no differences in rank order consistency between these groups roberts and delvecchio 2000 would hypothesize higher consistency in the two older groups and ardelt 2000 would predict higher consistency in the middle group than in the oldest group. we analyze data from the gzts and the neo-pi-r and to maximize time interval we also examine data from the neo inventory a precursor of the neo-pi-r.\\nprevious analyses costa & mccrae 1988 showed no systematic differences between men and women of different age groups on retest stability in neo-pi scales but no such comparisons have been made for the gzts. we therefore report gzts data separately for men and women in this study.\\ntoo few individuals n = 19 retested on the neo-pi-r were initially under age 30 to study that group but larger numbers of under-30 adults were retested with the gzts and we report supplementary analyses on that instrument to test the common view that stability is lower among adults under 30.\\nparticipants and procedure-the blsa is a multidisciplinary study of normal aging. participants have agreed to return for repeated assessments of biomedical and psychosocial variables. recruitment has been continuous over the course of the study so long-term participants have been assessed more frequently than more recently recruited participants. gzts data were collected during regularly scheduled visits starting for men in october 1958 and for women in january 1978 and continuing until may 2002. the gzts was administered to all participants at their first or second visit and subsequently approximately every 6 and then 12 years. retest stability over 6 and 12 years has previously been reported for gzts scales in the blsa sample costa & mccrae 1992a . the present study examined data for individuals whose first and last administrations were separated by at least 6 and as much as 42 years.\\nthe neo-pi-r was administered by computer between september 1989 and july 2004 during regularly scheduled visits terracciano mccrae brant & costa 2005. to obtain long-term stability coefficients retest correlations were computed between the first and last administration for individuals with a time interval between administrations of at least 6 years. note that there is no overlap between these data and those used in costa and mccrae\\'s 1988 study of the neo-pi further most of the individuals who took the neo-pi-r about 60% joined the blsa after the data collection for the earlier study.\\nfinally to maximize the time interval we also compared domain scores from individuals who had completed the neo inventory by mail in mccrae 1982 with domain scores from their latest administration of the neo-pi-r. a description of the subsamples that completed each instrument is given in table 1 . nih-pa author manuscript nih-pa author manuscript\\nmeasures-the gzts guilford et al. 1976 is a factor-based personality questionnaire composed of 300 items 30 for each of the 10 gzts scales. for each item participants choose between yes no and ?. any scale with more than three ? responses was considered missing a procedure suggested by guilford and colleagues. therefore there are small variations in the number of participants for different scales. data were standardized as tscores using the grand mean and standard deviations across all administrations. in the blsa  the structural stability of the gzts has been shown across age cohort and time-of-measurement.\\nthe revised neo personality inventory neo-pi-r costa & mccrae 1992b designed to measure the five-factor model ffm of personality consists of 240 items answered on a five-point likert format ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. the neo-pi-r assesses 30 facets six for each dimension of the ffm: neuroticism n extraversion e openness to experience o agreeableness a and conscientiousness c. t-scores for facets are standardized scores m = 50 sd = 10 based on combined-sex adult norms in the manual factor scores combining information from each of the 30 facets are also expressed as t-scores. evidence on reliability and validity is presented in the manual costa & mccrae 1992b. the neo inventory was a precursor of the neo-pi-r that assessed only n e and o domains. revisions introduced with the neo-pi-r changed 10 of the 144 n e and o items but these minor changes are unlikely to distort the long-term stability of the scales and should have no effect on the comparison of age differences in consistency.\\nbaseline comparison-we compared individuals included in the rank-order correlation analyses table 2 and 3 with those who had taken the gzts or neo-pi-r at least once but were not included because they had dropped out of the study had a retest interval of less then 6 years were younger than 30 at their first visit or had not been in the study long enough to be retested. for the gzts those excluded were about 2 years younger somewhat less educated and slightly more likely to be female. after controlling for those differences the excluded respondents scored significantly lower on emotional stability friendliness thoughtfulness and personal relations but none of the differences exceeded about 0.4 standard deviations in magnitude. similarly those excluded from the neo-pi-r analyses were younger less educated and more likely to be female after controlling for those differences respondents who were excluded were about 2 t-score points higher on o. in general it appears that respondents included in the analyses were similar to blsa participants in general.\\nretest correlations from first and last administrations in the total sample and in various age groups are reported in table 2 for the gzts and in table 3 for the neo-pi-r. retest intervals for each group are given at the bottom of each column. all correlations are significant with gzts scales and neo-pi-r facets near .70 and neo-pi-r factors near .80 consistent with previous literature. the coefficients in table 2 and 3 are underestimates of the true score stability given that personality scales are not perfectly reliable. to correct for attenuation of retest coefficients due to measurement error estimated stability coefficients can be obtained by dividing the observed coefficients by the short-term retest reliability. short-term e.g. two-week retest reliability coefficients have not been reported for the full neo-pi-r but using the two-year retest correlations reported by mccrae yik trapnell bond and paulhus 1998 of primary interest are the comparisons of the last three columns of tables 2 and 3 . consistent with roberts and delvecchio\\'s 2000 report adults aged 30-50 showed significantly lower rank-order consistency using fisher\\'s z-test than adults over age 50 on gzts sociability emotional stability and thoughtfulness in men and on general activity ascendance emotional stability and masculinity in women with small effect sizes ranging from q = .10 to .17 q = | fisher\\'s z 1 -z 2 | cohen 1988. the hypothesis from ardelt 2000 that stability declines after age 50 was supported for thoughtfulness in men q = .13 but women initially over age 65 were more rather than less consistent than women 50-65 on friendliness q = .20. no significant differences were found for gzts restraint objectivity or personal relations. these data thus provide mixed support for the hypothesis of continued increase in rank-order consistency between 30 and 50 but no consistent support for the hypothesis that stability declines after age 50. further the mean retest interval is substantially longer for the male group aged 30 to 50 compared to the other groups see table 2  which has the effect of reducing the retest correlation coefficients and might explain some of the above effects. analyses at the individual level will address this issue.\\namong the five neo-pi-r factors significant differences among groups can be seen only for extraversion with adults aged 50-65 showing higher consistency than adults over age 65 q = .06. among the 30 neo-pi-r facets the over-65 group showed lower rank-order stability on e2: gregariousness q = .13 and o3: feelings q = .11 but higher on o6: values q = .16. for the remaining 27 facets no significant effects were found providing no support for the hypotheses that rank-order stability of individual differences varies systematically with age after age 30.\\nin 1980 the neo inventory was completed by 257 respondents aged 30 and older who subsequently took the neo-pi-r an average of 19.0 years later range = 9-24 years. rankorder consistency for the n e and o domains were .73 .74 and .77 respectively for the full group. not surprisingly too few of these individuals were initially over age 65 to allow meaningful analyses. the 112 respondents initially aged 30-50 had retest correlations of . 76 .74 and .81 for n e and o respectively whereas the 145 respondents initially over age 50 had retest correlations of .71 .74 and .74. these data provide no support for the view that long-term stability is higher among those over 50.\\nwe conducted a supplementary analysis in which we examined rank-order consistency for gzts scales in respondents initially less than 30 years old ns = 101-117 men 39-46 women and retested after an average of 17.9 men or 10.2 women years. as expected they tended to show lower retest correlations ranging from .38 to .73 with median values of .58 in men and .64 in women.\\none limitation of the retest correlation analyses is that the retest interval differed for different age groups and consistency generally declines with longer retest intervals. it would be preferable to control statistically for the retest interval but the optimal form of that hierarchical regression analysis with asendorpf\\'s individual stability coefficients as dependent variable was performed on the combined male and female gzts sample n = 1063 controlling for initial age at step one which had minor effects and then introducing time interval and its square at steps two and three. as in table 2  analyses were limited to respondents initially over age 30 with a minimum retest interval of six years. all ten gzts scales showed some decline in individual stability with increasing retest interval but it was significant only for general activity ascendance sociability and personal relations which all declined at a decelerating rate. for these four scales linear and quadratic terms explain between .6% and 2.3% of the variance in individual stability beyond that accounted for by initial age.\\nbecause all gzts scales showed a similar form of decay we created an average individual stability score cronbach\\'s alpha = .58 across the ten gzts scales. as shown in figure 1  this mean was best predicted by a concave curve the linear and quadratic terms accounted for 2.7% of the variance. it is notable however that the curve does not resemble exponential decay instead of tending toward zero consistency it turns up after a retest interval of about 20 years. this should not be interpreted as evidence that stability increases with longer intervals it is instead simply a quadratic approximation to a plateau. in the language of fraley and roberts 2005 developmental constancy factors seem to operate such that retest stability of gzts scales does not decline further after retest intervals exceed 20 years there appears to be a non-zero asymptote.\\nexponential decay to a non-zero asymptote can be modeled with the nonlinear estimation program of statistica softstat 1995 using the equation where c is the asymptote b 0 and b 1 are exponential decay coefficients and t is the time interval in years. it is clear from figure 1 that c must be between .6 and .7 and we varied it systematically across this range. the optimal value was .655 leading to the equation figure 1 . this model accounted for 3.0% of the variance in mean individual stability scores somewhat more than the quadratic model. because the mean of the individual stability coefficients is equal to the retest correlation the asymptote can also be regarded as an estimate of the long-term stability for gzts scales: the lower bound for observed coefficients is about .65 and using reliability estimates from costa et al 1980 the lower bound for true scores is close to .80.\\nthe retest correlations in table 2 and 3 are easily understood but they are not optimal tests of the effects of age on rank-order consistency for two reasons. first they utilize only a portion of the available data namely the first and last administrations for individuals whose retest interval is at least 6 years. second they do not control for the time interval. for example the retest interval for the gzts was substantially longer in men 30-50 m = 20.2 years than in men 65+ m = 9.5 years and stability declines over longer time intervals at least up to 20 years.\\nto address these problems for each scale we calculated a measure of individual consistency the standard deviation for each individual across all available administrations. because sds are a measure of inconsistency we reflected the values 1 -sd to obtain an absolute measure of consistency. 2 note that this is a conservative measure of rank-order stability because normative changes in mean level which do not affect rank-order do lower these consistency scores. mean level changes however are generally modest in these data terracciano et al. 2005 . all respondents with at least two data points were included in this analysis and data from more than two administrations were used when available to obtain a best estimate of individual consistency. we also calculated the maximum retest interval as a control variable.\\nanalyses of individual consistency were based on 3281 administrations of the gzts from 1194 individuals and 4217 administrations of the neo-pi-r from the 1178 individuals who had at least two administrations. note that all the data reported in table 2 and 3 are included here but they are supplemented by data from additional administrations and retest intervals outside the limits used in the retest correlation analyses. examination of scatterplots showed a small number of outliers from 0 to 6 per scale which were recoded as three standard deviations above the mean. for each scale we conducted hierarchical multiple regressions in which we successively entered maximum retest interval and intervalsquared age and age-squared as predictors.\\nbecause gender does not have systematic effects on either rank-order consistency or the relation of rank-order consistency to age e.g. table 2  data from men and women were combined. only data from respondents initially over age 30 were included.\\n2 the correlations of asendorpf\\'s 1992 individual stability coefficient with our measure of consistency in the subsample with first and last administration at least 6 years apart ranged from .67 to .80 for the gzts scales and neo-pi-r factors. \\nmaximum retest interval and its square were entered as a block that was a significant predictor of consistency for all gzts scales and neo-pi-r factors accounting for from 0.4% to 4.1% of the variance in individual consistency scores. as expected longer retest intervals were modestly associated with lower consistency.\\nin the next block age was a significant linear predictor of stability for five gzts scales: consistency on restraint ascendance and personal relations increased cross-sectionally with age whereas consistency on general activity declined. 3 all of these effects were less than 1% accounting for from 0.4% to 0.7% of the variance in consistency scores. there were no significant linear age effects on emotional stability objectivity friendliness thoughtfulness or masculinity. only sociability showed significant curvilinear effects accounting for 0.7% of the variance in consistency scores.\\nthe only gzts scale that showed increasing consistency with older age at both the group table 2  women only and individual level analysis 3 was ascendance.\\nmultiple regression showed that individual consistency of the five neo-pi-r factors was unrelated to age or to age-squared. after age 30 consistency appears to have reached a plateau a result at the individual level that confirms the group level findings. of the 30 neo-pi-r facets only e3: assertiveness which is strongly correlated with ascendance  showed a significant linear increase in consistency explaining 0.4% of variance. curvilinear trends were found for o2: openness to aesthetics which increased up to age 60 and for o4: openness to actions and a4: compliance that both showed the lowest consistency values in middle adulthood. age and age-squared combined accounted for from 0.4% to 1.0% of the variance.\\nipsative stability or \"personcentered continuity\" caspi & roberts 2001 p. 52 refers to the stability of the configuration of personality traits in each individual. concern for ipsative stability or change was inaugurated by block 1971  who believed that it more adequately captured the integrated functioning of traits within the individual. the interpersonal activities of a sociable person may be inhibited by self-consciousness a small change in the relative balance of these two dispositions might lead to large changes in social behavior. from childhood to adolescence ipsative stability appears to be rather limited and there are substantial individual differences caspi & roberts 2001 .\\nipsative stability is most frequently assessed using longitudinal q-sort data. q-sort instruments require that a set of items be ordered from most to least characteristic of the person usually with a fixed distribution. block\\'s 1961 caq was originally intended for use by expert raters but was modified by bem and funder 1978 for use as a self-sort. ipsative stability is usually quantified as a q-or inverse correlation that is the correlation for each individual of first and second sort across the 100 items. costa mccrae and siegler 1999 reported q-correlations for 273 blsa participants retested on average after 6.6 years. these values ranged from .12 to .86 with a median of .71 for men and .72 for women.\\nin the present study we report data from an expanded blsa sample stratified by age group.\\n3 the declining consistency in general activity may seem puzzling given the high retest correlations for that scale in table 2 . this effect is probably due to the accelerated decline in the mean level of general activity in old age terracciano et al. 2005 to which our measure of consistency is sensitive. nih-pa author manuscript nih-pa author manuscript nih-pa author manuscript q-correlations based on raw caq data represent the degree to which individuals report the same ordering of characteristics across two time points and to the extent that the reports are accurate gives a straightforward estimate of the stability of the trait configuration. however there is a sense in which such q-correlations are inflated because the items of the caq have different normative values. at any given time almost all individuals are likely to claim that \"is genuinely dependable\" is more characteristic of them than \"is guileful deceitful\" mccrae terracciano costa & ozer 2006 . because of these differences in item desirability q-correlations between any two people are usually positive and often substantial ozer & gjerde 1989 . it is not clear from an analysis of raw caq items how much of the observed stability is due to the relative permanence of trait configurations in the individual and how much is due to enduring social norms about item endorsement.\\nmccrae et al. 2006 therefore recommended that caq items first be standardized across persons to remove differences due to item endorsement norms. q-correlations can then be calculated on the standardized items and age differences in standardized ipsative stability can be examined. these values are likely to be substantially less than the median values of . 70 typically reported in adult samples because they exclude stability attributable to enduring social norms of item endorsement.\\nhowever lower standardized ipsative stability coefficients would not necessarily imply that there are major changes in the configuration of traits across adulthood because single items are apt to be unreliable. more reliable assessments of personality are given by factors from the caq items which can be interpreted in terms of the dimensions of the ffm. qcorrelations can be computed across these five factor scores on two occasions.\\nparticipants and procedures-blsa participants completed the bem and funder 1978 modification of block\\'s 1971 caq during their regular visits to the gerontology research center. sorting 100 items into 9 fixed categories is a challenging task especially for older participants and a first longitudinal analysis costa et al. 1999 suggested that a few participants had been confused about the direction of the sort putting most characteristic items in the least characteristic bin. in subsequent analyses we correlated each q-sort with the normative values of the 100 items defined by their means across all administrations. of 2289 administrations 31 showed a negative correlation with the normative values and were discarded. the caq was readministered approximately every 6 years for the present study we analysed data from the first two administrations with a minimum retest interval of 4 years. characteristics of this subsample are given in the last line of table 1 . a comparison of individuals with and without a second caq sort showed that those not retested were more likely to be women 50% vs. 38% were initially tested about 6 years later and curiously were about one-eighth standard deviation higher in conscientiousness. there were no differences on the other personality factors.\\ninstrument-the caq was developed to provide a comprehensive description of personality traits with a particularly emphasis on clinical description block 1961. in the self-sort version respondents arrange the 100 items into 9 categories with a fixed number of items in each approximating a normal distribution. analyses of some of the first administration data in the blsa mccrae costa & busch 1986 showed that the caq included items from all five factors of the ffm and that a five-factor structure captured most of the common variance in caq items cf. lanning 1994. five varimax-rotated factors were extracted from the intercorrelation of the caq items on both occasions yielding the expected n e o a and c factors. retest correlations for these factors ranged from .70 for c to .80 for e. q-correlations across the two occasions were computed across these five factor scores.\\nin this subsample of blsa participants q-correlations based on raw caq items ranged from −.06 to .89 the median was .70 for men and .73 for women. table 4 reports mean ipsative stability coefficients for the total and by age groups. the rows report results for raw caq items standardized caq items and caq factors. as expected the standardized items showed lower levels of ipsative stability than the raw items because stability coefficients are not inflated by item response norms. the clearest evidence of ipsative stability is given by the analysis of the more reliable caq factors which are not inflated by item response norms and provide a measure of the degree to which the relative ordering i.e. profile of the five factor scores within an individual persists over time.\\nof primary interest here are the comparisons of ipsative stability across age groups. preliminary analyses including gender as a classifying factor showed that there were no gender × age group interactions so further analyses were conducted on the combined sample. ipsative stability based on standardized caq items was significantly higher in middle-aged men and women than in older adults which is consistent with ardelt\\'s 2000 claim that stability declines after age 50. here age accounted for 1.8% of the variance in qcorrelations. however there were no significant age differences between younger and middle-aged adults and there were no significant differences between any of the groups when ipsative stability was based on raw caq items or caq factors. 4 results were unchanged when retest interval was used as a covariate.\\nthe retest correlations in tables 2 and 3 confirm the well-established fact that the rank-order consistency of personality traits in adulthood is quite high. for the total group the median retest correlations across all scales is .70. this value is almost as high as that estimated by roberts and delvecchio 2000 for their most stable age group .75 at age 50-59 despite the fact that the retest interval in the present study ranged from 10 to 16 years whereas roberts and delvecchio\\'s was only 6.7 years. high rank-order consistency in adulthood is equally characteristic of men and women.\\nthe focus of interest in the present study was the relation of age to rank-order consistency after age 30. mccrae and costa 1990 and meta-analyses by roberts and delvecchio 2000 and ardelt 2000 all suggested that stability should be lower in the decade of the 20s than in later age periods and that view was supported by supplementary analyses of the gzts scales. the main issue the present study hoped to resolve was whether rank-order consistency reached a plateau by age 30 or continued to increase after that age. the evidence was mixed: for some gzts scales there were significant differences between retest correlations for respondents under 50 and over age 50 and in every case the lower correlations were found in the younger group. however most scales including all neo-pi-r factors and most facets failed to show significant differences between these age groups. analyses of individual consistency which controlled for retest interval provided partial support for roberts and delvecchio\\'s 2000 hypothesis of increasing consistency for four gzts scales but not for the other gzts scales or for any of the neo-pi-r factors.\\n4 a supplementary analysis including a group of 54 men and women aged 17 to 30 showed that they did not differ from any of the older groups on the three measures of ipsative stability. ardelt 2000 reported a curvilinear relation of age to stability with declines after age 50. we found no support for that view despite the large number of old and very old participants in the blsa. provided that they remain cognitively intact siegler et al. 1991  older individuals show remarkable rank-order consistency in personality traits.\\nadults of all ages also show considerable ipsative stability of personality. there were no consistent age differences in ipsative stability and the most accurate and reliably assessed measure based on the profile of five factor scores derived from the caq showed no significant age differences. the stable \"configuration of traits\" predicted by mccrae and costa 1990 p. 10 was clearly found here for adults of all ages.\\nall of the indicators of rank-order stability are lowered by unreliability and several previous studies e.g. costa et al. 1980 costa & mccrae 1992c have demonstrated that disattenuation for retest unreliability substantially increases coefficients with estimates of the true score stability as high as .87 over a 24-year interval costa & mccrae 1992c. personality traits are indeed enduring dispositions. nevertheless it is also true that these estimated consistency coefficients rarely attain 1.0. the present analyses of retest interval confirmed earlier findings that stability decays slowly with the passage of time though never approaching zero. these declines in consistency may have two sources: they may represent small accumulated effects due to random processes that affect all individuals such as the gradual atrophy of the brain resnick pham kraut zonderman & davatzikos 2003  or they may be due to the presence in the sample of a small number of individuals who show substantial personality change perhaps as a result of traumatic events or an episode of depression. costa & mccrae 1994  described these two kinds of change as the \"crumbling\" and \"cracking\" of the set plaster of personality. the existence of a small subset of individuals with significant change can be seen in figure 1 and had been suggested by hlm analyses of neo-pi-r and gzts data where significant individual variations in longitudinal slopes were found terracciano et al. 2005 . in this study we used a novel simple absolute measure of consistency at the individual level that could be related to biological and environmental variables in future studies.\\nthe present data provide at least some support for the view that there are subtle increases in rank-order consistency between age 30 and age 50 especially for measures of ascendance or assertiveness. roberts and delvecchio 2000 interpreted such findings as evidence of cultural change in the century since william james opined that personality was \"set like plaster\" after age 30 james 1890james /1981. data from that era are not available and so subtle a change might simply have escaped james\\'s notice. roberts and delvecchio\\'s hypothesis could be tested however in cross-cultural longitudinal studies. if personality development is paced by the demands and opportunities of the culture then stability should be reached more quickly in underdeveloped nations where full adult responsibilities are assumed at earlier ages. at present there are no longitudinal studies of personality traits in underdeveloped nations testing the roberts and delvecchio hypothesis would be one of many reasons to inaugurate them.\\nalthough a decline in stability with increasing time interval is generally found over relatively short time intervals ten years or less few longitudinal studies have examined the effect of elapsed time on the consistency of personality traits over several decades. the exceptionally long time interval between gzts assessments was used to examine the effect of time on stability at the individual level. surprisingly the expected pattern of continuing exponential decay was not observed: for six of the gzts scales individual stability coefficients were not significantly related to the length of the retest interval for four scales and for mean stability the data were best modeled by a concave quadratic curve suggesting a decelerating pattern of decline up to about a 20 years interval and then a plateau.\\nfraley and roberts 2005 attributed non-zero asymptotic declines in rank-order consistency to developmental constancy factors such as enduring dna. they argued that other factors including person-environment transactions and stochastic-contextual processes were also needed to account for long-term patterns of continuity and claimed that \"a model that excludes the role of environmental experiences … simply cannot account for the empirical patterns of stability and change that we have presented\" p. 71. but their interpretation goes beyond the data examined. it is true that there must be sources of medium-term stability that affect trait levels for periods of a few years and then fade away but these sources need not be environmental. genes are activated and silenced during the course of development fraga et al. 2005 plomin 1986  perhaps a subset of personality-related genes are switched on for several years and then switched off. the data fraley and roberts examined like ours do not speak to this issue.\\nthese gzts data are certainly not definitive. they are based on a single instrument and relatively few of the respondents none of the women had retest intervals over 30 years see figure 1 . a further complication is introduced by the fact that many participants had taken the gzts more than twice and repeated \"practice\" on the same instrument might conceivably inflate stability. however if these gzts data accurately reflect the developmental course of personality traits then previous estimates of lifetime stability must be revised upwards. costa and mccrae 1992c using a model of exponential decay estimated that 60% of true score variance was constant over the full 50-year adult lifespan. the present data suggest that perhaps as much as 80% is constant.',

for 1976-2001 do in fact show such cooling up to 0.6°c decade -1  at all the west coast areas listed above except portugal. recent local observational studies have also detected coastal cooling e.g.

discovered socab coastal cooling might likewise continue over the next 50 years although a similar series of wrf simulations by zhao et al. 2011 for all of california did not show coastal-cooling perhaps because they forced their simulations with output from the older parallel climate model pcm model. while previous studies generally attributed observed jja asymmetric warming in coastal

developmental aging disease progression changes in the cerebral cortex. however most existing brain segmentation methods consider multiple timepoint images individually and thus cannot achieve longitudinal consistency. for example cortical thickness measured from the segmented image will contain unnecessary temporal variations which will affect the time related change pattern and eventually reduce the statistical power of analysis. in this paper we propose a 4d segmentation framework for the adult brain mr images with the constraint of cortical thickness variations. specifically we utilize local intensity information to address the intensity inhomogeneity spatial cortical thickness constraint to maintain the cortical thickness being within a reasonable range and temporal cortical thickness variation constraint in neighboring time-points to suppress the artificial variations. the proposed method has been tested on blsa dataset and adni dataset with promising results. both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method in comparison to other state-of-the-art 4d segmentation methods.',

for stem major choices in colleges. few studies have considered a progressive learning activity embedded within stem contexts. this study chose computer-based learning activities in k-12 math classrooms as a major pre-college learning predictor for stem major choices. using a nationally represented sample drawn from the educational longitudinal study of 2002/06 the purpose of this study was two-fold: a to investigate the influence of computer-based learning activities in math classrooms on stem major choices in 4-year post-secondary institutions and b to analyze the extent to which math teacher motivation affects math performance and math self-efficacy across schools which plays a vital role in students' stem major selection. the multilevel structural equation modeling revealed several findings. first computer-based learning activities had a greater positive effect on math self-efficacy that significantly predicted the increase in the proportion of students' stem major choices compared to the individual-and lecture-based learning activities. second a positive relationship between individual-based learning activities and math performance emerged which was associated with the high proportion of students' stem major choices. third at the high school level math teacher motivation positively influenced math performance. these results suggest that integrating stem contexts into traditional learning activities in math curriculum at the k-12 level would increase students' interests in studying stem disciplines. equally important is enhancing math teachers'

withstand stressful abiotic conditions through the maintenance of hydrologic feedbacks between vegetation production and flooding. however disruption of these feedbacks can lead to ecosystem collapse or a regime shift from vegetated wetland to open water. to prevent the loss of critical coastal wetland habitat we must improve understanding of the abiotic-biotic linkages among flooding and wetland stability. the aim of this research was to identify characteristic landscape patterns and thresholds of wetland degradation that can be used to identify areas of vulnerability reduce flooding threats and improve habitat quality.\\n• methods we measured local-and landscape-scale responses of coastal wetland vegetation to flooding stress in healthy and degrading coastal wetlands. we hypothesized that conversion of spartina patens wetlands to open water could be defined by a distinct change in landscape configuration pattern and that this change would occur at a discrete elevation threshold.\\n• key results despite similarities in total land and water cover we observed differences in the landscape configuration of vegetated and open water pixels in healthy and degrading wetlands. healthy wetlands were more aggregated and degrading wetlands were more fragmented. generally greater aggregation was associated with higher wetland elevation and better drainage compared with fragmented wetlands which had lower elevation and poor drainage. the relationship between vegetation cover and elevation was non-linear and the conversion from vegetated wetland to open water occurred beyond an elevation threshold of hydrologic stress. • conclusions the elevation threshold defined a transition zone where healthy aggregated wetland converted to a degrading fragmented wetland beyond an elevation threshold of 0.09 m [1988 north american vertical datum navd88] [0.27 m mean sea level msl] and complete conversion to open water occurred beyond 0.03 m navd88 0.21 m

have added to and further specified these core components of teachers' professional knowledge e.g. grossman 1995 sherin 1996 shulman 1987 . in the research literature on teaching and teacher education there is a shared understanding that domain-specific and general pedagogical knowledge and skills are important determinants of instructional quality that affect students' learning gains and motivational development bransford darling-hammond & lepage 2005 bransford derry berliner & hammerness 2005 grossman & mcdonald 2008 grossman & schoenfeld 2005 hiebert morris berk & jansen 2007 munby russell & martin 2001 reynolds 1989 . yet few empirical studies to date have assessed the various components of teachers' knowledge directly and used them to predict instructional quality and student outcomes fennema et al. 1996 harbison & hanushek 1992 hill ball blunk goffney & rowan 2007 hill rowan & ball 2005 mullens murnane & willet 1996 rowan chiang & miller 1997 . the national mathematics advisory panel 2008 summarizes the situation as follows:\\nfinally with the exception of one study that directly measured the mathematical knowledge used in teaching no studies identified by the panel probed the dynamic that would examine how elementary and middle school teachers' mathematical knowledge affects instructional quality students' opportunities to learn and gains in achievement over time. p. 37 in this article we present findings from a 1-year study in which mathematical teachers' ck and pck were assessed directly and linked to data from a comprehensive assessment of mathematics instruction and student outcomes. the core question guiding the study was whether these two components of teacher knowledge each make a unique contribution to explaining differences in the quality of instruction and student progress.\\nthe coactiv 1 study was conducted in germany from 2003 to 2004 as a national extension to the 2003 cycle of the organisation for economic co-operation and development's programme for international student assessment pisa prenzel baumert et al. 2006 . the study which had two measurement points surveyed a nationally representative sample of grade 10 classes and their mathematics teachers. its objective was to investigate the implications of ck and pck for processes of learning and instruction in secondary level mathematics kunter et al. 2007 kunter klusmann & baumert 2009 . to this end we used newly constructed knowledge tests to assess teacher knowledge directly. the teacher data were then linked to data on aspects of instruction and student outcomes. specifically we investigated the following hypotheses: that ck and pck represent distinct knowledge categories that pck is directly associated with the quality of instruction and that its effect on student learning is mediated by the quality of instruction.\\nthere is consensus in the teacher education literature that a strong knowledge of the subject taught is a core component of teacher competence e.g. american council on education 1999 grossman & schoenfeld 2005 mewborn 2003 national council of teachers of mathematics 2000 national mathematics advisory panel 2008. opinions on what exactly is meant by subject matter knowledge are divided however even for mathematics. there is disagreement on the necessary breadth and depth of teachers' mathematical training cf. ball & bass 2003 deng 2007 shulman & quinlan 1996 : do secondary mathematics teachers need a command of the academic research knowledge taught in the mathematics departments of universities? or is it mathematical knowledge for teaching that matters integrating both mathematical and instructional knowledge as taught at schools of education? there is however agreement among mathematics educators that ''teachers must know in detail and from a more advanced perspective the mathematical content they are responsible for teaching . . . both prior to and beyond the level they are assigned to teach'' national mathematics advisory panel 2008 p. 37. what is required is a conceptual understanding of the material to be taught mewborn 2003 it is thus all the more surprising that quantitative research on teacher competence is based almost exclusively on proxies such as certification status and mathematics course work completed cochran-smith & zeichner 2005 . qualitative studies in contrast have closely examined the importance of a conceptual understanding of the content to be taught ball lubienski & mewborn 2001 leinhardt 2001 . in the following we first outline the findings of quantitative studies that use distal indicators of teacher knowledge or that conceptualize ck as knowledge of high school mathematics. we then present findings from qualitative studies. finally we consider the findings of the research group led by deborah ball at the university of michigan. this group was the first to measure elementary school teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching directly and to examine its relationship to student progress hill et al. 2005 .\\nin recent years a number of review articles have been published providing overviews of quantitative studies that have for the most part used distal baumert et al.\\nat max planck ins on july 27 2011 http://aerj.aera.net downloaded from indicators of teachers' knowledge and made no distinction between ck and pck ballou & podgursky 2000 d'agostino & powers 2009 darlinghammond 2000 floden & meniketti 2005 goe 2007 wayne & youngs 2003 wilson & floden 2003 .\\nseveral studies have investigated whether state certification as an indicator of teacher quality is reflected in enhanced student learning gains. when certification in a subject is assessed and correlated with student achievement in the same domain findings tend to indicate a positive relationship especially for mathematics. the most important evidence to this effect is provided by goldhaber and brewer's reanalyses 2000 of the national education longitudinal study data and darling-hammond's analyses 2000 with combined data from the schools and staffing survey and mathematics and reading data from the national assessment for educational progress. findings on teachers' qualifications major/minor or b.a./m.a. and course attendance are rather more complex. the empirical basis is provided by the work of goldhaber and brewer 2000 monk 1994 and rowan et al. 1997 . higher teacher qualifications tend to be associated with better student performance at secondary level particularly in mathematics. findings for the number of courses attended in the teaching subject are inconsistent across school subjects but generally positive for mathematics. exposure to teachers who took more mathematics courses during the university-based phase of teacher training seems to have positive effects on secondary students' learning gains. monk 1994 reported interactions with students' prior knowledge: the higher the students' prior knowledge the more important the subject matter component of teacher training. monk also found decreasing marginal returns on course attendance. neither of these findings has yet been replicated. there is a clear need for studies that assess teachers' ck by means other than distal measures national mathematics advisory panel 2008.\\ngiven the widespread agreement that teachers must know the mathematical content they are responsible for teaching not only from a more advanced perspective but beyond the level they are assigned to teach it is surprising that several empirical studies on the impact of teacher knowledge have conceptualized teachers' mathematical ck as knowledge of high school or even elementary school mathematics. harbison and hanushek 1992 administered a mathematics test to fourth graders in rural areas of brazil as well as to their teachers and used the teacher scores to predict change in students' scores in grade 4. mullens and colleagues 1996 ck. in these studies both indicators proved to predict student learning gains in mathematics. drawing on data from the national education longitudinal study of 1988 rowan et al. 1997 found a positive relationship between students' learning gains and teachers' mathematical ck as assessed by a single test item tapping teachers' knowledge of high school mathematics. even the latest comparative international assessment conducted by the international association for the evaluation of educational achievement the teacher education and development study in mathematics assesses teachers' ck at the level of advanced high school knowledge schmidt et al. 2007  despite attempts made in the pilot study to conceptualize it at a higher level blömeke kaiser & lehmann 2008 .\\na considerable body of qualitative studies on the structure and effects of teacher knowledge has developed in the last 20 years providing a rather more informative picture than that of the distal approach ball et al. 2001 leinhardt 2001 stodolsky & grossman 1995 . one of the major findings of qualitative studies on mathematics instruction is that the repertoire of teaching strategies and the pool of alternative mathematical representations and explanations available to teachers in the classroom are largely dependent on the breadth and depth of their conceptual understanding of the subject. studies in which teachers were presented with examples of critical classroom events revealed that an insufficient understanding of mathematical content limits teachers' capacity to explain and represent that content to students in a sense-making way a deficit that cannot be offset by pedagogical skills. ball 1990 and ma 1999 demonstrated this relationship for multiplication and place values borko et al. 1992 and simon 1993  for division even 1993  stein baxter and leinhardt 1990  and heaton 2000  for patterns and functions and putnam heaton prawat and remillard 1992 for geometry. given their case studies putnam et al. concluded that the efforts of teachers with a limited conceptual understanding ''fell short of providing students with powerful mathematical experiences'' p. 221.\\nin her comparison of teachers in china and the united states ma 1999 showed that a ''profound understanding of fundamental mathematics'' is reflected in a broad repertoire of pedagogical strategies over a range of mathematical topics. the breadth depth and flexibility of chinese teachers' understanding of the mathematics they teach afford them a broader and more varied repertoire of strategies for representing and explaining mathematical content than what is available to their colleagues in the united states. intervention studies show that enhancement of mathematical ck can lead to higher-quality instruction e.g. fennema & franke 1992 swafford jones & baumert et al.\\nat max planck ins on july 27 2011 http://aerj.aera.net downloaded from thornton 1997 . qualitative research on teacher knowledge acknowledges that the mathematical ck required for high-quality instruction is not general mathematical knowledge that is picked up incidentally but professionspecific knowledge that is acquired in university-level training and can be cultivated through systematic reflection on classroom experience ball et al. 2001 berliner 1994 grossman 2008 .\\nck is not a panacea however. findings show that ck remains inert in the classroom unless accompanied by a rich repertoire of mathematical knowledge and skills relating directly to the curriculum instruction and student learning. the case study by eisenhart et al. 1993 brought fame to ms. daniels who had a reasonable conceptual understanding of the division of fractions but was unable to present her students with a correct mathematical representation of the problem. similar findings have been reported for rates a. g. thompson & p. w. thompson 1996  p. w. thompson & a. g. thompson 1994 and for multiplication ball 1991 . these findings are complemented by case studies of specific instructional episodes which show that teachers with equivalent levels of subject matter knowledge may differ considerably in their pedagogical repertoire and skills depending on their teaching experience schoenfeld 1998 schoenfeld minstrell & van zee 2000 . pck thus seems to vary-at least to a certain degree-independently of ck and to be a knowledge component in its own right.\\nin the words of kahan cooper and bethea 2003  strong mathematical ck seems to be ''a factor in recognizing and seizing teachable moments'' p. 245 but it does not guarantee powerful mathematical experiences for students. what is required here is pck ''which involves bundles of understandings that combine knowledge of mathematics of students and of pedagogy '' ball et al. 2001 p. 453. according to ball and colleagues 2001 it is pck in particular that underlies the development and selection of tasks the choice of representations and explanations the facilitation of productive classroom discourse the interpretation of student responses the checking of student understanding and the swift and correct analysis of student errors and difficulties. in summary findings suggest that-in mathematics at least-a profound understanding of the subject matter taught is a necessary but far from sufficient precondition for providing insightful instruction see also borko & livingston 1989 kahan et al. 2003 .\\ndrawing on both ck and pck the research group headed by deborah ball at the university of michigan has developed a theoretical framework and set of measurement instruments for the assessment of elementary school teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching ball & bass 2003 hill 2007 hill schilling & ball 2004 . ball and colleagues see mathematics teachers' professional ck as the mathematics they need to know in order to teach effectively. on this basis they distinguish common knowledge of content the mathematical everyday knowledge that all educated adults should have from specialized knowledge of content the specialist knowledge acquired through professional training and classroom experience hill et al. 2004 schilling & hill 2007 . they further distinguish a third dimension of mathematical knowledge which links mathematical content and student thinking typical errors or student strategies-namely knowledge of students and content. three content areas of elementary school mathematics are distinguished: numbers/operations patterns/functions and algebra. the michigan group used a matrix of these content areas and knowledge dimensions as a theoretical structure for developing test items in which items were allocated to individual cells of the matrix on the basis of a priori theoretical considerations.\\nwe can gain insights into the michigan group's conceptualization of its knowledge dimensions by taking a closer look at its descriptions of these dimensions and published test items. first items developed to tap common knowledge of content draw on everyday knowledge ''what is the number halfway between 1.1 and 1.11?'' ''can the number 8 be written as 008?'' as well as on typical secondary school knowledge that is often lost after school ''what power of ten equals one? '' hill et al. 2004 . second the authors see teachers' specialized knowledge of content as both a conceptual understanding of topics typically taught at school ''show that any number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4'' and the specific knowledge required for teaching ''including building or examining alternative representations providing explanations and evaluating unconventional student methods '' hill et al. 2004 p. 16-that is knowledge that could also be classified as pck ball et al. 2001 . third items tapping knowledge of students and content assess diagnostic skills such as evaluating the diagnostic potential of tasks or recognizing typical student errors hill et al. 2004 schilling & hill 2007 -another facet of pck. hill et al. 2004 and schilling 2007 tested their theoretical model with a large sample of teachers at california's mathematics professional development institutes. the empirical findings did not provide support for the complex structure of the model. rather exploratory factor analyses suggested a model with three factors: two content factors numbers/operations and patterns/functions/algebra and a student factor that seems to tap diagnostic skills. common knowledge and specialized knowledge of content were not empirically distinguishable. given these analyses the authors decided to develop a unidimensional item response theory-scaled test to assess elementary school teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching that included both common knowledge items and specialized baumert et al.\\nat max planck ins on july 27 2011 http://aerj.aera.net downloaded from knowledge items but no items tapping students' thinking. this test thus assesses an amalgam of the mathematical everyday knowledge needed by adults the conceptual understanding of mathematical topics typically taught at elementary school and the mathematical knowledge relating directly to the instructional process pck excluding diagnostic skills.\\nhill et al. 2005 examined the predictive validity of their competence measure by using the item response theory score to predict elementary students' learning gains. they drew on a sample of schools participating in three comprehensive school reform programs and a matched group of control schools. multilevel analyses showed that elementary teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching indeed predicted students' learning gains in two different grades in fact the effect was practically linear. this study provided the first conclusive evidence for the practical importance of teachers' mathematical knowledge in terms of both the mathematical knowledge that adults use in everyday life and the specialized knowledge that teachers use in classrooms. from a video study of 10 teachers hill and colleagues 2007 presented more qualitative data indicating that mathematical knowledge for teaching as assessed by the michigan group is also associated with the mathematical quality of instruction. thus this test seems to provide a good overall assessment of mathematical knowledge for teaching but it does not test the implications of ck and pck for instruction. insights into these mechanisms are particularly important for the design of teachertraining programs however.\\nwhat kind of subject matter knowledge do teachers need to be well prepared for their instructional tasks? to what degree does their mastery of the content influence their instructional repertoire? to address these questions we need to draw a theoretical and empirical distinction between ck and pck and examine their implications for teaching and learning. the present study therefore investigates specific samples of teachers who-as a result of their different training-can be expected to differ substantially in terms of both ck and pck.\\nthe present research evolved as part of the coactiv study conducted at the max planck institute for human development berlin in collaboration with mathematicians at the universities of kassel bielefeld and oldenburg. coactiv investigates the professional knowledge of secondary school mathematics teachers. the objective is to conceptualize and measure ck and pck separately to determine the implications of each component of teachers' professional knowledge for processes of instruction and learning krauss brunner et al. 2008 kunter et al. 2007 .\\nthe coactiv framework draws on the work of deng 2007 goodson anstead and mangan 1998 quinlan 1996 and stengel 1997  who have pinpointed the specific and at the same time related nature of knowledge embedded in academic disciplines and school subjects. this approach clearly differs from conceptions that localize teacher ck at the level of advanced high school knowledge e.g. schmidt et al. 2007 . for reasons of theoretical clarification krauss baumert and blum 2008 proposed the following hierarchical classification of mathematical knowledge: a the academic research knowledge generated at institutes of higher education b a profound mathematical understanding of the mathematics taught at school c a command of the school mathematics covered at the level taught and d the mathematical everyday knowledge that adults retain after leaving school. we conceptualize mathematics teachers' ck as the second type: a profound mathematical understanding of the curricular content to be taught. this approach is in line with the national council of teachers of mathematics 2000 and the national mathematics advisory panel 2008 which refer to a conceptual understanding of the mathematics to be taught. ck required for teaching has its foundations in the academic reference discipline but it is a domain of knowledge in its own right that is defined by the curriculum and continuously developed on the basis of feedback from instructional practice deng 2007 goodson & marsh 1996 mitchell & barth 1999 .\\nmoreover the coactiv framework assumes that this ck is theoretically distinguishable from pck which forms a distinct body of instruction-and student-related mathematical knowledge and skills-the knowledge that makes mathematics accessible to students. from suggestions by shulman 1986 distinguished three dimensions of pck: knowledge of mathematical tasks as instructional tools knowledge of students' thinking and assessment of understanding and knowledge of multiple representations and explanations of mathematical problems cf. ball et al. 2001. these three components were derived by considering the demands of mathematics instruction:\\n1. one defining characteristic of mathematics instruction is that it is choreographed through the teacher's selection and implementation of tasks and activities. tasks and subsequent task activities create learning opportunities and determine the internal logic of instruction the level of challenge and the level of understanding that can be attained de corte greer & verschaffel 1996 hiebert et al. 2005 . knowledge of the potential of mathematical tasks to facilitate learning is thus a key dimension of pck. 2. teachers have to work with students' existing beliefs and prior knowledge.\\nknowledge of student beliefs misconceptions typical errors frequently used baumert et al.\\nat max planck ins on july 27 2011 http://aerj.aera.net downloaded from strategies and the ability to diagnose students' abilities prior knowledge knowledge gaps and strategies are thus a core component of pck. errors and mistakes in particular provide valuable insights into students' implicit knowledge vosniadou & vamvakoussi 2005 vosniadou & verschaffel 2004 . 3. knowledge acquisition and especially the achievement of a deep understanding of mathematical content are active processes of construction. these processes require guidance and support however mayer 2004 sfard 2003  particularly when comprehension problems occur. one of the ways in which teachers can support students' mathematical understanding is by offering multiple representations and explanations.\\ngiven these theoretical considerations the coactiv group has developed a ck test to assess teachers' deep understanding of the mathematical content covered in secondary school as well as a separate pck test to assess their knowledge of tasks student ideas and representations and explanations. as krauss brunner et al. 2008 have shown confirmatory factor analyses support the theoretically postulated two-factor structure of mathematics teachers' subject matter knowledge. the two factors show substantial intercorrelation r latent 5 .79 that increases as a function of teachers' expertise but are clearly distinguishable. for each test a one-dimensional twoparameter item response theory model provides a good fit to the empirical data. the technical details of the tests are presented in the method section. in a validation study with samples of advanced university students majoring in mathematics certified mathematics teachers biology and chemistry teachers and high school students in advanced placement courses in mathematics found empirical evidence for the classification of mathematical ck as proposed above as well as for the conception of ck and pck as specific facets of teachers' professional knowledge.\\nas forms of domain-specific professional knowledge ck and pck are thought to be acquired through formal training at the university level supervised internships and reflected teaching experience and not picked up incidentally. we expect the level of knowledge attained to depend on the length intensity and quality of the teacher-training program attended. germany offers a unique natural experiment for testing the relationship between teachers' ck/pck and type of training. whereas in the united states there is much variety in preservice training grossman & mcdonald 2008 zeichner & conklin 2005  thereby making it difficult for researchers to define treatments and provide evidence for effects teacher education in germany is standardized by the state. moreover universities and colleges offer two distinct teacher education programs corresponding with the tracking system implemented after grade 4. in almost all german states students approaching the end of grade 4 are assigned to different secondary tracks-usually in separate schools-on the basis of their performance to date. the number of tracks implemented ranges from two gymnasium sekundarschule to four gymnasium realschule hauptschule gesamtschule. in all states however a clear distinction is made between the academic track gymnasium and the nonacademic tracks. this distinction is reflected in the structure of teacher training. teacher candidates aspiring to teach at secondary level must choose between degree programs qualifying them to teach in either the academic track gymnasium 5-year training program or the other secondary tracks e.g. realschule or sekundarschule 4-year training program. the university curricula are state regulated with the basic structure being determined at federal level and the two program types differ in certain ways across all states. in terms of subject matter courses the requirements for the academic track certification type 1 are on average one third higher than those for the nonacademic tracks certification type 2. in terms of teaching methods courses requirements are similar for both certification types. if at all they are higher in nonacademic track programs. teacher candidates for the academic track attend the same subject matter courses as students majoring in mathematics in mathematics departments. teacher candidates for the nonacademic tracks attend subject matter courses taught by mathematics educators in mathematics departments or in schools of education who are also responsible for the methods courses in both types of program. having completed the universitybased part of their training all teacher candidates enter a structured and supervised induction program lasting 18-24 months.\\na third group of teachers was certified in the former german democratic republic certification type 3 having attended training programs lasting 4 years until 1982 or 5 years 1983-1989. in many cases courses covered both subject matter and teaching methods making it impossible to quantify the amount of time allocated to each. these integrated training programs included an internship of several months.\\nif ck as we conceptualize it is indeed dependent on the type of training program attended teachers of the different certification types can be expected to differ markedly in their ck even when selective intake to the programs is controlled. specifically we expect type 1 teachers to outscore their colleagues of the other types. it is harder to make predictions for pck. because we hypothesize ck to be a necessary condition for pck we expect type 1 teachers to outscore type 2 teachers in pck but the differences between the two groups to be much smaller than for ck. we do not expect these differences in pck in favor of type 1 teachers to persist when ck is controlled. given the integrated nature of their training no predictions can be made with respect to the pck scores of teachers certified in the former german democratic republic type 3.\\nbaumert et al.\\nat max planck ins on july 27 2011 http://aerj.aera.net downloaded from\\nthe differential implications of ck and pck for teaching and student progress pck is inconceivable without ck. given the findings of the qualitative case studies described above however we assume that pck is needed over and above ck to stimulate insightful learning. we address our hypothesis that ck and pck have differential implications for teaching and learning by testing the predictive significance of the two knowledge constructs .\\nas seidel and shavelson 2007 have pointed out the reviews and metaanalyses summarizing the state of research on learning and instruction over the last two decades differ considerably in terms of the labeling and categorization of teaching variables. it is thus difficult to compare effect sizes. nevertheless although the terminology differs three components of instruction have emerged consistently as being crucial for initiating and sustaining insightful learning processes in mathematics lessons \", 'da58f8d1-3f68-49ad-88fc-97ea4c726c25': \"abstract prostate-specific antigen psa velocity predicts the presence of prostate cancer on biopsy and a greater risk of prostate cancer death after radical treatment. a new variation on psa velocity called the risk count was recently shown to provide incremental reclassification for intermediate to high-grade disease on biopsy beyond psa and age. these markers therefore have the potential to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent prostate cancer and several professional guidelines support the use of psa kinetics along with other predictors as part of the diagnostic algorithm. among men already diagnosed with prostate cancer psa kinetics may also be helpful in predicting prognosis after definitive therapy. jnccn 201311:281-285 and has been known since the early 1990s to increase the specificity of psa-based screening for prostate cancer detection.\\n3 this is important because prostate biopsies have potential associated risks 4 such that reducing false-positive screening tests is an important objective. among men aged 50 years and younger without prostate cancer the median psav is approximately 0.00 to 0.03 ng/ml/y. 5 6 recent studies have suggested that the baseline psav may be useful for risk stratification in young men.\\n7 at the other end of the spectrum psav may also be useful in guiding the discontinuation of screening in elderly men. 8 9 another area in which improvements are needed is distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease. a large body of evidence now shows a strong relationship between psav and more aggressive prostate cancer features. for example in 1073 men from a large radical prostatectomy series insignificant tumors were present in 10% of men with a psav less than 0.4 ng/ml/y and in only 5% of men with a psav greater than 0.4 ng/ml/y. 10 these results suggested that psav may be a marker for clinically significant prostate cancer. another recent study of 219388 us men from kaiser permanente showed that the annual percent change in psa was significantly better than the total psa for discriminating high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy area under the receiver operating curve of 0.955 vs. 0.727 respectively.\\npsav has also been shown to predict prostate cancer-specific mortality. in a landmark study d'amico et al 12 reported that a psav greater than 2 ng/ml/y predicted a greater risk of prostate cancer death after radical prostatectomy. these authors subsequently validated the relationship between a psav greater than 2 ng/ml/y and the risk of mortality after radiation therapy.\\nthe independent relationship between psav and long-term treatment outcomes was also although prostate cancer screening with prostatespecific antigen psa has been shown to reduce metastases and mortality from prostate cancer 12 its use has numerous drawbacks. a key issue is its limited specificity for clinically significant prostate cancer resulting in unnecessary biopsies overdiagnosis and overtreatment. fortunately the way that screening is performed has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades and there are several variations on the psa test itself with improved performance characteristics.\\none of these variations is psa velocity psav which is a metric of the change in psa level over time\",

studies. the method is simpler to use than other one-and two-dimensional hydrodynamic models because it does not require marsh depth and tidal prism information however the one-dimensional diffusion analogy model cannot be used to estimate tide heights flow velocities and tide arrival times for tide conditions other than the highest tide for which it is calibrated. limited validation of the method indicates that it has an accuracy within 0.3 feet. the method can be applied with limited calibration information that is based entirely on remote sensing or geographic information system data

determined whereas final family size is still a decision variable. a couple can more easily influence the quality of their children through familysize decisions than by trying to change their socioeconomic status. all this advice rests on the premise that the effect of family size on child quality is causal. if the effect is not causal couples only reducing the desired number of children will not see improved quality in their children.\\nto date almost all the evidence for the relationship between sibship size and child quality comes from conventional regression analysis using cross-sectional data and the causal interpretation of the statistical relationship has been frequently questioned. the alternative interpretation is that the statistically found negative relationship between sibship size and child quality is spurious induced by another factor or combination of other factors highly correlated with sibship size such as family socioeconomic status in this study we

image analysis. given a set of longitudinal images from different subjects the task of longitudinal atlas construction is to build an atlas sequence which can represent the trend of anatomical changes of the population. the major challenge for longitudinal atlas construction is how to effectively incorporate both the subject-specific information and population information to build the unbiased atlases. in this paper a novel groupwise longitudinal atlas construction framework is proposed to address this challenge and the main contributions of the proposed framework lie in the following aspects: 1 the subject-specific longitudinal information is captured by building the growth model for each subject. 2 the longitudinal atlas sequence is constructed by performing groupwise registration among all the subject image sequences and only one transformation is needed to transform each subject's image sequence to the atlas space. the constructed longitudinal atlases are unbiased and no explicit template is assumed. 3 the proposed method is general where the number of longitudinal images of each subject and the time points at which they are taken can be different. the proposed method is extensively evaluated on two longitudinal databases namely the blsa and adni databases to construct the longitudinal atlas sequence. it is also compared with a state-of-the-art longitudinal atlas construction algorithm based on kernel regression on the temporal domain. experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves higher registration accuracies and more consistent spatial-temporal correspondences than the compared method on both databases. © 2011 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.\\nlongitudinal atlas construction is an active research topic in longitudinal data analysis and it plays an important role in medical image analysis. its applications include but not limited to disease tracking fox et al. 2000  population analysis freeborough and fox 1997 and anatomical structure analysis cardenas et al. 2007 . the task of longitudinal atlas construction is to estimate an atlas sequence in the temporal domain which can reflect the trend of anatomical changes in the population based on a given set of longitudinal image sequences from different subjects. the major challenge for longitudinal atlas construction is how to effectively encode both the intra-subject longitudinal change and the inter-subject difference in the constructed atlas sequence.\\nlongitudinal atlas construction methods can be broadly classified into two categories: 1 longitudinal atlas construction by kernel regression or mixture modeling over the temporal domain davis et al. 2007 davis et al.  2010 sabuncu et al. 2009 hart et al. 2010  2 longitudinal atlas sequence estimated by joint alignment of subject image sequences to a template sequence durrleman et al. 2009 . a representative of the kernel regression based atlas construction methods is the method proposed by davis et al. davis et al. 2007  where the longitudinal atlases at different time points are constructed by a kernel regression process over the temporal domain on the riemannian manifold represented by diffeomorphisms. the contribution of each image during the regression process to construct the atlases is determined by the kernel weight. in davis et al. 2007 davis et al.   2010  the nadaraya-watson kernel regression process is extended by formulating the regression problem based on the fréchet mean. this method is designed for random design data and therefore there is no subjectspecific longitudinal information considered. also it may lead to temporal inconsistency between the images taken at different time points of the same subject. the schematic representation of this method is shown by fig. 1a . also durrleman et al. 2009 e-mail address: dgshen@med.unc.edu d. shen. 1 data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the alzheimers

1993 . perhaps the best data for normal elderly are provided by the mayo's older american normative studies but the data published for the tmt do not extend above age 82 ivnik et al. 1996 . rarely has the issue of error rate been addressed. further investigation of age effects on tmt completion times and error rate is warranted by recent reports that tmt part b is useful in discriminating dementia from normal aging. cahn et al. 1995 found part b to be among the variables entering a logistic regression model discriminating between demented and nondemented elderly individuals. similarly part b was also among the variables entering a multiple logistic regression equation predicting new dementia cases dal forno corrada resnick & kawas 1995 . thus the tmt may be useful in predicting dementia.\\nthe goals of the present study were 1 to describe cross-sectional age effects on the tmt in a large sample aged 60 to 93 years 2 to describe two-year longitudinal changes on the tmt in a subset of this sample and 3 to examine the utility of the tmt in discriminating cognitive dysfunction from normal aging.\"}\n"

      "section: abstract abstract-in this paper we propose a general framework for performance improvement of the current state-of-the-art registration algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computation time. the key concept involves rapid prediction of a deformation field for registration initialization which is achieved by a statistical correlation model learned between image appearances and deformation fields. this allows us to immediately bring a template image as close as possible to a subject image that we need to register. the task of the registration algorithm is hence reduced to estimating small deformation between the subject image and the initially warped template image i.e. the intermediate template it. specifically to obtain a good subject-specific initial deformation support vector regression is utilized to determine the correlation between image appearances and their respective deformation fields. when registering a new subject onto the template an initial deformation field is first predicted based on the subject's image appearance for generating an it. with the it only the residual deformation needs to be estimated presenting much less challenge to the existing registration algorithms. our learning-based framework affords two important advantages: 1 by requiring only the estimation of the residual deformation between the it and the subject image the computation time can be greatly reduced 2 by leveraging good deformation initialization local minima giving suboptimal solution could be avoided. our framework has been extensively evaluated using medical images from different sources and the results indicate that on top of accuracy improvement significant registration speedup can be achieved as compared with the case where no prediction of initial deformation is performed.\n",

      "section: abstract the underrepresentation of minority teachers and male teachers remains an issue in u.s. elementary education and there is evidence that racial interactions partly shape student performance. however there is little work on discrimination within the classroom. do teachers give better grades to children of their own race ethnicity or gender? a u.s. nationally representative longitudinal data set that includes both test scores and teacher assessments offers a unique opportunity to answer this question. i look at the effect of being assessed by a same-race or same-gender teacher conditional on test scores child effects and teacher effects. this strategy controls for three confounding effects: i children of different races and genders may react differently in the classroom and during examinations ii teachers may capture skills that are not captured by test scores and iii tough teachers may be matched with specific races or genders. results indicate that teachers give higher assessments to children of their own race but not significantly higher assessments to children of their own gender. this effect seems to be driven largely by the differential assessments given to non-hispanic black and hispanic children: white teachers give significantly lower assessments to non-hispanic black children and to hispanic children. results are robust to various checks on endogenous mobility measurement error and reverse causality. moreover children's behavior is not a significant determinant of same-race or same-gender matching. finally relative grading does not explain the main results of this paper.\n",

      "section: abstract weight loss and worsening of nutritional state is a frequent downfall of acute hospitalization in older people. it is usually accepted that acute inflammation is responsible for hypercatabolism. however several studies suggest on the contrary a reduction in resting energy expenditure ree. this study aimed to obtain a reliable measure of ree and total energy expenditure tee in older patients hospitalized for an acute episode in order to better assess patients' energy requirements and help understand the mechanisms of weight loss in this situation. nineteen hospitalized older patients mean age 83 years with c-reactive protein crp level >20mg/l were recruited. ree and tee were measured using gold standard methods of indirect calorimetry and doubly labeled water dlw respectively. ree was then compared to data from a previous study on aged volunteers from nursing homes who were free of an acute stressor event. energy requirements measured by dlw were confirmed at 1.3 × ree. energy intake covered the needs but did not prevent weight loss in these patients. tee was not increased in hospitalized patients and was not influenced by inflammation while the relationship between ree and inflammation was uncertain. our results suggest that lean mass remains the major determinant of ree in hospitalized older people and that weight loss may not be explained solely by a state of hypercatabolism.\n",

      "section: abstract to develop targeted intervention strategies for the treatment of alzheimer's disease we first need to identify early markers of brain changes that occur before the onset of cognitive impairment. here we examine changes in resting-state brain function in humans from the baltimore longitudinal study of aging. we compared longitudinal changes in regional cerebral blood flow rcbf assessed by 15 o-water pet over a mean 7 year period between participants who eventually developed cognitive impairment n ϭ 22 and those who remained cognitively normal n ϭ 99. annual pet assessments began an average of 11 years before the onset of cognitive impairment in the subsequently impaired group so all participants were cognitively normal during the scanning interval. a voxel-based mixed model analysis was used to compare groups with and without subsequent impairment. participants with subsequent impairment showed significantly greater longitudinal rcbf increases in orbitofrontal medial frontal and anterior cingulate regions and greater longitudinal decreases in parietal temporal and thalamic regions compared with those who maintained cognitive health. these changes were linear in nature and were not influenced by longitudinal changes in regional tissue volume. although all participants were cognitively normal during the scanning interval most of the accelerated rcbf changes seen in the subsequently impaired group occurred within regions thought to be critical for the maintenance of cognitive function. these changes also occurred within regions that show early accumulation of pathology in alzheimer's disease suggesting that there may be a connection between early pathologic change and early changes in brain function.\n",

      "given the role of igf-ii in satellite cell proliferation 19 and the age-associated decrease in igf2 gene expression in response to muscle damage 35 it is possible that igf-ii could influence acute regenerative capacity in aging human muscle in a way that the cumulative effect of these diminished responses to exercise or to increasing oxidative stress with age 18 could influence rates of age-associated losses in muscle mass and strength in humans 22.\n",
      "the two igf2 genotype studies mentioned above have demonstrated lower body mass and body mass index bmi 41 and grip strength 51 in men homozygous for the rare a allele of the 3ј-untranslated region apai polymorphism. based on these findings 41 51 and the suggested influence of igf-ii on adult body weight 31 and given the established relationships between body weight and fat-free mass ffm across the adult age span 11 we hypothesized that men and women homozygous for the a allele at the igf2 apai locus would have significantly lower muscle mass strength and power at peak age 35 yr 30 than men and women homozygous for the common g allele. moreover this difference between genotype groups would be maintained at age 65 and across the adult age span. given the evidence of the role of igf-ii in muscle regeneration and previous findings showing greater body mass 41 and grip strength 51 in middle-aged igf2 apai g homozygous men our secondary hypothesis was that men and women homozygous for the a allele would have significantly greater rates of loss of muscle strength and power with age.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we implement a non-stacked single direction RNN model with LSTM cells, consisting of a single `LSTM Cell` that handles the computations for the LSTM architecture, including `input`, `forget`, `cell`, and `output` gates with appropriate `weight initializations`. The LSTM class aggregates multiple time steps, updating the hidden and cell states at each step while producing an output based on the last hidden state. The model is trained using the `Adam optimizer` and `cross-entropy loss` to predict sequences, making it a non-stacked, single-directional RNN because it processes the input sequentially without additional LSTM layers or bidirectional connections. The BIO-tagged data serves as the labels, while the extracted features are used as input data, which is converted into vectors\n",

    "Both RNN + LSTM and CRF models used the same testing set and learning rate (0.0002). CRF was implemented using TorchCRF library. As shown from the results the RNN + LSTM had an accuracy almost on par with the CRF with 97.06% accuracy while CRF had 97.53%. The RNN + LSTM was able to have worse recall of 0.6490 which is significantly lower than CRF's recall of 0.9753. The RNN + LSTM, however, seem to converge faster reaching 0.00103 at the 10th epoch while CRF only reaching 0.4002. The NER labels of train and testing sets are stored in the ner_json.txt and test_ner_json.txt files, respectively."
